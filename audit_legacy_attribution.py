    is 6.5 MB of untracked PDNC fixtures today, and four artifacts' verdicts
    moved between supported_measurement and historical_only depending purely
    on whether the machine happened to have them.

    checkout cannot tell them apart: the untracked file simply is not there.
    Recording the difference is what broke the first attempt at this fix - the
    machine holding the fixture wrote an extra field that CI could never
    reproduce. Which artifacts have gold on this machine but not in the
    repository is reported by --check on stderr, where it is a message to the
