# Idempotent llama-server for a given LoRA adapter.
#
# OWNERSHIP IS THE BUG THIS FIXES. Previously one script started the server and
# a different one pkilled it on exit, so whether a server existed depended on
# which script happened to run last. A retry died with SERVER_GONE for exactly
# that reason on 2026-08-04.
#
# The inversion: the CALLER never kills the server. This script reuses a
# healthy one already serving the requested adapter, and replaces it only when
# something different is needed. A server therefore outlives the job that
# started it, which is what lets consecutive evals share one load.
#
# Usage:
#   ./ensure_llama_server.sh [adapter.gguf]
#
# Environment:
#   LLAMA_BIN     llama-server binary      (default: llama-server from PATH)
#   LLAMA_MODEL   base GGUF                (required)
#   LLAMA_PORT    port                     (default 8090)
#   LLAMA_CTX     context length           (default 32768)
#   LLAMA_LOG     server log path          (default ~/llama_server.log)
set -uo pipefail

ADAPTER="${1:-}"
# RESOLVE FROM PATH FIRST. This defaulted to a hand-built
# ~/llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-server, and when that path was empty the script
# exited 2 - which read as "no llama.cpp on this machine" while a maintained
# one sat on PATH the whole time. On this box llama-server comes from the
# `llama.cpp-hip` package, so `pacman -Syu` keeps it current; preferring a
# hand-built copy would silently pin every run to whatever was compiled once
# and never updated, and would quietly change the engine underneath a
# comparison whose earlier arms used the packaged build.
#
# LLAMA_BIN still overrides, for deliberately testing a specific build.
