# Goal 5.3's second scored book, with production exhaustion semantics.
#
# WHY THIS RERUN. Last night produced ONE scored comparison, not four.
# owarimonogatari3's three-pass arm died after 38m on a single one-entry batch
# it could not attribute, and the harness drops a book whole when one arm
# fails - correctly, since scoring one arm against gold while the other failed
# would publish a comparison that is not one.
#
# The abort itself was not a bug: three_pass_generate defaults to
# on_exhaustion='fail' so a failure rate stays visible. But 5.3 asks which
# METHOD is more accurate, and production runs 'fallback', where an
# unresolvable span becomes UNKNOWN instead of killing a 4454-entry book. That
# is the arm a user actually gets, so it is the arm to score.
#
# Only owarimonogatari3 runs. mushoku16 already has both arms from last night
# and its three-pass never exhausted, so fallback would change nothing there -
# rerunning it would cost two hours to reproduce a number already on disk.
# grimgar03 and index18 are excluded for reasons fallback cannot fix: the
# former fails chunk 1 of its SINGLE arm on qwen3-14b, the latter is refused by
# the source gate over 6,662 U+FFFD before any model sees it.
