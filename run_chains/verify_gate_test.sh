# NO GPU_LOCK EXPORT. This line used to name $HOME/.alexandria_gpu.lock, a
# third lock file that serialised against neither the repo lock the other
# chains use nor gpu_job.sh's own - and it sat BELOW the self-re-exec above,
# so this chain's outer wrapper and its inner jobs took different locks.
# gpu_job.sh now defaults to the repo lock; letting it decide is the point.
