# Stage 1: the counter-example, with an EXPLICIT medoid reference.
# Stage 2: every remaining recoverable adapter, same treatment.
#
# Why stage 1 first. husky_baritone_40s_m_military has a mismatched reference
# (0.133) and a CLEAN dataset (0.772) - the same profile as
# husky_baritone_20s_m_anime, which recovered 0.004 -> 0.691. It did not
# recover: 0.141 -> 0.149. The difference is that those retrains used
# train_lora's FALLBACK reference (the first training clip), which is a
# lottery. --use-medoid removes that variable.
#
#   recovers  -> the counter-example dissolves and the reference theory is
#                complete; run stage 2 with confidence
#   does not  -> there is a second failure mode, and stage 2 would waste hours
#                retraining adapters against something not yet understood
