# Overnight queue, ~4h. Two jobs, in this order for a reason.
#
# 1. GATE THE PROMOTION CANDIDATES. Seven retrained adapters beat their shipped
#    counterparts on held-out ECAPA. That score came from the retrain runs
#    themselves, so it is the number the training loop reported about its own
#    output. The gate is an independent re-measurement, and it is the thing
#    standing between here and overwriting seven shipped voices. It runs first
#    because it unblocks a decision, and it is cheap.
#
# 2. RE-MEASURE GOALS 2.5 AND 2.6 AT PROPER SAMPLE SIZE. Both are currently
#    recorded OPEN on twelve clips per language. Twelve is thin enough that the
#    finding could be sample size rather than signal, and an OPEN goal asserts a
#    failure - a claim that should not rest on twelve samples. At 100 clips
#    either the gap survives, and it is real, or it moves, and we retract a
#    false OPEN. Both outcomes are worth the card time; that is what makes this
#    worth running rather than merely unrun.
#
# Ordering: the gate first so a morning with a dead card still has the decision.
