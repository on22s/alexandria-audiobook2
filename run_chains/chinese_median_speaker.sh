# Close goal 2.6's Chinese cell by re-running the arm on a typical speaker.
#
# THE FINDING THIS TESTS. Chinese LoRA measures HNR 1.17x its narrator. Clip
# length was ruled out (moves it 0.0025) and the corpus was ruled out
# (AISHELL-3 medians 12.02 dB, CLEANER than LJSpeech's 10.83). What remains is
# the eval speaker herself: SSB1585 sits at 9.39 dB, 2.63 below her corpus
# median, at the 8th percentile of 40 sampled speakers.
#
# SSB0748 is the replacement, chosen as the closest speaker to the corpus
# median: 12.025 dB, +0.005 off. Every other setting matches the original run -
# same trainer, same lr 1e-6, 6 epochs, lora_r 64, same seed - so the speaker
# is the only thing that changes.
#
# THE PREDICTION, WRITTEN DOWN BEFORE THE RUN. If the ratio is a property of
# speaker selection, SSB0748's arm lands near 0.93x - inside the 0.85-1.15
# band - because the generated side already measures 11.17 dB against a corpus
# that medians 12.02. If it lands near 1.17x again, speaker selection was the
# wrong explanation too and the adapter is implicated after all. Recording the
# prediction here so the result cannot be re-narrated afterwards either way.
