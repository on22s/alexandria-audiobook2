# ORDER MATTERS. The cheap bookkeeping runs first so that if anything goes

# 2 & 3. DRIFT AT BOOK LENGTH (~4h each).
#
# THE OPEN QUESTION. Every voice measurement in this project was a single line
# until yesterday, when 400 consecutive lines showed a small downward drift:
# -0.018 on husky_tenor_30s_m_literary and -0.050 on warm_mezzo_30s_f_fantasy_2,
# with pitch rising while vocal tract length and HNR held. A real audiobook is
# five to twenty thousand lines, and the 400-line result explicitly does not
# license a claim about 5000: whether drift is linear, plateaus, or accelerates
# is unmeasured.
#
# 2000 lines is five times the previous run and enough to separate those three
# shapes. The same two adapters are used deliberately - extending a measurement
# is worth more than starting a third one, and voice_drift skips lines it has
# already generated, so the first 400 of each are already on disk.

# 4. A THIRD ADAPTER, NOT PREVIOUSLY DRIFT-TESTED (~4h). The first two extend
#    existing 400-line measurements; this one asks whether the shape holds on
#    an adapter that has never been run long. If drift is a property of long
#    generation rather than of particular voices - which is what all three
#    moving the same direction suggested - this should look like the others.
#    If it does not, "drift" is really "these two adapters drift".
