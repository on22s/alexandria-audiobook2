# The three-pass comparison, with a server this job owns end to end.
#
# REPLACES an ad-hoc /tmp version that made two of the three mistakes
# gpu_job.sh's header calls out:
#
#   1. It waited with `while pgrep -f relaunch_chain.sh`. pgrep matches on a
#      pattern, which is a guess about what else is running; this waits on the
#      actual PID instead, passed in, and confirms the completion marker.
#   2. It started llama-server with nohup and never stopped it. The model is
#      12 GB on a 15.9 GB card, so it stayed resident after the run and would
#      have blocked every later TTS job. gpu_job.sh deliberately does not
#      manage servers - "those belong to the job" - so the job that starts the
#      server is the one that stops it, in the same shell, via a trap.
#
# Usage: ./tpvs2_chain.sh [PID-to-wait-for]
