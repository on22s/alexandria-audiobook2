# Retrain the five adapters diagnosed as REBUILD-DATASET, plus a repeat of the
# one control that collapsed.
#
# WHY, given the diagnosis said retraining them was pointless: that reasoning
# assumed training was deterministic. It is not. On 2026-08-07 five clean-data
# failures all improved on a rerun with identical settings, two of them by
# +0.66 and +0.57 - 0.027 became 0.685. So "the dataset is mixed, a retrain
# reproduces the same average" is an inference that has not been tested since
# the determinism assumption fell.
#
# warm_tenor_20s_m repeats because it dropped 0.725 -> 0.382 as a control while
# the other two controls moved -0.012 and -0.017. One reading is contamination
# it was flattered by; another is the same training lottery. A repeat separates
# them.
