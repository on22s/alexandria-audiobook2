# Overnight: answer goals 5.3 and 3.1 in one run, on the shipped model.
#
# WHY ONE RUN ANSWERS BOTH. 5.3 has NO BASELINE because the only three-pass
# comparison on disk recorded timing but never accuracy, and its single arm
# failed outright on grimgar03 and index18. 3.1 is OPEN because no saved book
# was ever generated with qwen3-14b, so its failure figures come from a model
# that does not ship. Generating all four books through both arms produces the
# accuracy comparison 5.3 wants AND a chunk-completion record attributable to
# qwen3-14b, which is exactly what 3.1 is missing.
#
# THE MODEL SETUP, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE DEFAULT ONE.
#   - app/config.json pointed at qwen2.5-14b, the model 3.1 explicitly says is
#     not the shipped path. It now names qwen3-14b; the original is backed up
#     at ab_test_runtime/logs/config.json.pre_qwen3_backup and RESTORED at the
#     end of this script, including on failure.
#   - llama-server runs with --chat-template-kwargs '{"enable_thinking":false}'.
#     Qwen3 is a thinking model: asked for 16 tokens it spent all of them on
#     reasoning and returned empty content, which the pipeline would see as a
#     failed chunk. Disabling thinking server-side means no app code changes
#     and no token budget spent on reasoning. Verified before launching:
#     content 'ready', reasoning absent, finish_reason stop.
#
# WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS RUN WORTHLESS. If the server dies, every chunk fails and
# the morning shows a 0% completion rate that says nothing about qwen3-14b. So
# the endpoint is re-checked before the long stage starts, and the run refuses
# rather than producing a number that would be read as a model result.
