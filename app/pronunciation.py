"""A per-book pronunciation lexicon for names the TTS cannot guess.

46% of the active book's lines contain a Latinized Japanese proper noun -
`Subaru` alone in 811 of 2,609 - and an English-trained model has no way to
know that it is SU-ba-ru rather than soo-BAR-oo. Observed errors already
include `rom and` heard as `roman` and `rezero` as `risero`.

WHY A LEXICON RATHER THAN BETTER PROMPTING. The pronunciation of a name is a
fact about the book, not about the model or the sentence. It belongs in data
that a person can correct once and have applied everywhere, which is the same
reasoning behind `character_aliases.json` and `voice_config.json`.

ORTHOGRAPHIC, NOT PHONETIC. Qwen3-TTS takes text; there is no phoneme input to
address. So an entry is a RESPELLING - "Subaru" -> "Soo-bah-roo" - which the
model reads as ordinary text. That is a real limitation: respelling is a blunt
instrument compared with IPA, and what respelling actually helps is an
empirical question per name.

WHICH IS WHY THIS SHIPS EMPTY. The mechanism is here; the entries are not
guessed. `proper_noun_pronunciation.py` provides the harness to test candidate
respellings against real lines, and an entry should be added because it was
measured to help, not because it looked right.

A TENSION WORTH STATING BEFORE ANYONE MEASURES THIS. WER is the wrong gate for
a lexicon. Validation scores the transcript against the ORIGINAL text, which is
correct - "Subaru" is what the book says. But if a respelling makes the model
say the name properly and the ASR then transcribes it as "Soo bah roo", WER
gets WORSE while the audio gets BETTER. A lexicon is judged by listening, or by
an ASR comparison that normalises the name on both sides. Optimising it against
raw WER would select for names that are easy to transcribe rather than right.

    """Every written form of every character that ACTUALLY OCCURS in the text.

    WHY DERIVED RATHER THAN LISTED. The first version of this file carried a
    hardcoded list of thirteen names typed from memory. It included Ram and
    Rem, who do not appear in this book at all, and it would silently have no
    entry for a character it forgot or for any other book. The roster already
    exists in character_aliases.json and voice_config.json; a second list
    beside them is the parallel-maintenance problem this repo has been bitten
    by before.

    ALIASES ARE USED FOR DISCOVERY, NEVER FOR SUBSTITUTION. The alias map
    records IDENTITY - 'BETTY' -> 'BEATRICE' is one character - while a
    lexicon records SOUND, and those come apart. Speaking "Betty" as
    "Beatrice" would put a word in the audio that is not in the book, which is
    worse than mispronouncing it. So every written form gets its own entry and
    the canonical name confers nothing on its variants.

    CASE IS LOAD-BEARING. `Felt` is a character here and `felt` is a verb:
    242 and 65 occurrences in the same book. Matching case-insensitively would
    rewrite the verb. Only forms that occur with their own capitalisation are
    returned.
