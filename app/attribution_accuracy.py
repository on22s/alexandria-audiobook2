"""Score a run's attributions against hand-judged answers.

Every gate in the pipeline checks form - valid JSON, byte-exact text, non-empty
speaker - and none checks whether the speaker is *right*. So correctness bugs
stayed invisible until someone read the output: the SPOKEN type leak, the
WEARING hallucination and the roster feedback loop all passed their unit tests.

This gives correctness a number that moves when the pipeline changes.

The fixture holds only HARD lines - every one is a case where two decoders
disagreed - so absolute accuracy is expected to be low. Track the delta between
runs, not the absolute figure.
