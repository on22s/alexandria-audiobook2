        lines, so joining them finds nothing.
      * The model modernises archaic orthography. Carroll writes "ca'n't";
        the model emits "can't", so Alice's line matches her own book zero
        times while being an obviously faithful rendering.

    Exact matching therefore reports 0 - "the model invented this" - for text
