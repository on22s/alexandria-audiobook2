    The single implementation for both gates. Roster admission passes a higher
    min_attestations because a bad name there propagates to every later batch,
    while the output gate only has to judge one entry. They previously had
    separate implementations and drifted: the output gate was fixed for
    hyphenated names and the roster gate was not, so build_roster went on
    rejecting Bri-chan after validate_attribution had started accepting him.
