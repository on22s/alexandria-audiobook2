"""Tests for the render guard.

The defect: tts.py's generate_* methods return False on failure instead of
raising, and every harness ignored that boolean and checked os.path.exists
instead. With a WAV left at that path by an earlier run, a FAILED generation
was scored as a success on STALE AUDIO - invisible to the harness, and wrong in
a direction nobody checks.

Each test below corresponds to one way that could happen.
