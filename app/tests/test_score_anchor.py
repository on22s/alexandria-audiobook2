"""A ceiling below the arms it bounds must not pass silently.

WHAT HAPPENED. The voice comparison scores each generated arm against a
`human_vs_human` anchor - the same narrator reading different held-out
material - because an ECAPA similarity means nothing without knowing what one
person scores against herself.

On 2026-08-06 three language arms were scored and read side by side:

    English    ceiling 0.809   arms 0.690 / 0.757    median clip 7.33s
    Japanese   ceiling 0.796   arms 0.755 / 0.779    median clip 4.71s
    Chinese    ceiling 0.691   arms 0.720 / 0.765    median clip 3.17s

In Chinese the narrator matched herself WORSE than a synthetic voice matched
her, so the anchor was not measuring speaker identity there and its arm
comparison could not be read. The scorer printed "human_vs_human is the
CEILING" and said nothing, and all three sets were compared as though sound.

These tests pin the detection, not the explanation. Short clips are the
leading hypothesis for why the Chinese anchor collapsed - it has the shortest
audio by a wide margin - but that is untested and the code says so.
