"""No score artifact on disk may publish comparisons under a broken ceiling.

WHAT `test_score_anchor.py` ALREADY COVERS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.
`find_invalid_anchors` is tested there against constructed inputs: given a
ceiling below its arms, does the detector notice. That pins the detector.

It does not pin the artifacts. Goal 6.1 is not "the detector works", it is
"0 comparisons published from an eval set with an invalid anchor" - a claim
about the files this repo actually ships. A correct detector whose output
nobody reads produces exactly the 2026-08-06 failure it was written for: the
Chinese anchor sat below both its arms, the scorer printed a line about the
ceiling, and all three sets were read side by side anyway.

So this walks every `*_score.json` in the evidence tree and asserts the arms
are bounded. It is deliberately a test over real artifacts rather than
fixtures: fixtures cannot go stale, and staleness is the failure mode here -
someone re-scores one set, the anchor regresses, and nothing objects because
the detector still passes its own unit tests.

An artifact that predates the `anchor_invalid` field is not silently accepted.
Missing evidence and clean evidence are different states, and treating the
first as the second is how an unbounded comparison gets published.
