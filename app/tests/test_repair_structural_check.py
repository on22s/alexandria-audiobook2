"""A repair that removes every marker and breaks the prose is not a repair.

WHAT THIS PREVENTS. The first version of the repairer substituted a dash for
every unresolvable run. Runs that were "em dash + closing quote" became two
dashes, so 69 dialogue lines opened a quote and never closed it. Quote
imbalance went to 25.1% where undamaged books run 0.5-3.4%.

The consequence was not cosmetic. index18's chunk 10 fed the model a passage
whose speech never closed; it generated until it hit the 16,384-token ceiling,
failed coverage, and retried at 6.5 minutes an attempt, nine times. The repair
had reported 100% success.

So the repairer now checks its own output, and the check distinguishes two
things:

    REGRESSIONS - shapes measured to break generation. These refuse the write.
    SHARE       - a heuristic. A quote spanning paragraphs is normal prose and
                  counts as unbalanced, so this cannot reach zero and only
                  warns.

These tests pin both, and pin that the historical failure is refused.
