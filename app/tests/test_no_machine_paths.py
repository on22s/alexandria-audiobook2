"""No absolute path to one person's machine may appear in executable source.

WHY THIS IS A TEST AND NOT A CONVENTION. 77 experiment scripts opened with

    REPO = "/home/fakemitch/pinokio/api/alexandria-audiobook2.git"

on a project whose GPU work runs on a disposable cloud instance where that
directory does not exist. It worked there only through a symlink recorded
nowhere, and on 2026-08-04 a failure inside a file physically living under
/home/ubuntu printed a /home/fakemitch traceback.

That was fixed. Then the fix was described as complete, and it was not: the
`REPO` assignment had been migrated while **41 other absolute references
survived**, 33 of them `sys.path.insert` lines. An external reviewer found them
the same day. A grep is exactly the kind of check a person does once and a test
does every time, which is why this exists rather than another careful sweep.

WHAT COUNTS AS MACHINE-SPECIFIC. A path rooted at a named user's home
directory. Not `~`, not `os.path.expanduser`, not an environment variable with
a sensible default - those relocate. A literal `/home/<someone>/...` does not.

Documentation is deliberately NOT covered. A work log recording that a
traceback showed `/home/fakemitch/...` is reporting evidence, and rewriting
history to look portable would be worse than the original problem.
