"""A source that repeats itself must not be rejected for being reproduced.

WHAT THIS COST. grimgar03 could not be generated at all. Its source opens with
"Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash: Volume 3" eight times - the file carries it 49
times - and the model transcribed those title lines faithfully on every one of
17 attempts. `find_adjacent_duplicate_blocks` flagged entries 1-8 as an
adjacent duplicate block, and the repair refused to act unless the block
appeared in the source EXACTLY once. At 49 occurrences it returned
"unresolved", the chunk was rejected, and after the retry budget the book
failed at chunk 1 of 49.

The model was right every time. The gate was wrong.

THE OLD TEST CONFLATED OPPOSITE CASES. `source_occurrences != 1` treats "the
model invented this repetition" and "the source genuinely repeats this" as the
same failure, when they call for opposite handling:

    0    invented - nothing can decide which copy is correct. Unresolved.
    1    duplicated - the source has it once, so delete the second copy.
    >=2  faithful - the SOURCE repeats it, so keep both. Deleting a copy
         would corrupt the text the model was asked to reproduce exactly.

These tests pin all three, because the middle case is the one the repair
already handled correctly and must keep handling.
