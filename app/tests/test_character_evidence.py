"""Tests for reading character gender out of narration.

Three cheaper approaches were tried on the live book and rejected with numbers,
and the tests below encode why, so nobody reintroduces one:

    own dialogue          Subaru read FEMALE - his lines are full of "she" and
                          "her" because he talks about Emilia and Felt.
    pronouns near name    "Subaru looked at her" - 71% masculine, unusable.
    single-name sentences "She waited. Subaru saw her." - still only 74%.

What works better is two constructions that USUALLY bind to the clause subject
- a reflexive, and the possessor of a body part - plus an INTERVENING-NAME rule
that discards a match when another known character is named in between. The
constructions alone were not enough: an external review reproduced "Subaru
watched Emilia raise her hand" scoring feminine for Subaru, so the original
claim that they "cannot float to another referent" was wrong.

With the rule and a roster, on the live book: Subaru 83/11 MALE, Reinhard 14/1
MALE, ROM 9/0 MALE, Emilia 0/9 FEMALE, SATELLA 3/12 FEMALE - all correct, and
cleaner than without it.

Abstention is a feature. FELT (9/14) comes back "unknown" rather than being
forced, because a wrong answer costs a main character their voice while silence
costs nothing - "unknown" already means "do not filter, do not penalise"
everywhere downstream.
