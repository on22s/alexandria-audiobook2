"""Every generation path must actually read the seed it is given.

THE BUG THIS LOCKS DOWN. `generate_lora_voice` contained 121 lines and zero
occurrences of the word `seed`, while its three sibling paths all read
`voice_data["seed"]` and called `torch.manual_seed`. So the seed field was
accepted, stored in voice_config, displayed in the UI - and silently ignored.
Every line of every `lora` voice was an independent draw, including NARRATOR,
which speaks 1,581 of this book's 2,606 lines.

It survived because nothing tested for it. Six experiment comparisons were run
on the contaminated output and had to be re-run, and the *measured* consequence
was large: seeding cut the non-prose failure count from 21/25 to 11/25.

The user found it by LISTENING and saying it sounded like several narrators.
The same instability had already been measured twice and misfiled twice - once
as YIN octave error, once as model behaviour.

WHY THIS TESTS PLUMBING AND NOT AUDIO. An end-to-end waveform check needs the
model on a GPU, so it can only ever run on one machine and would be skipped
everywhere else - which is the same as not existing. The defect was never
subtle acoustics; it was a line of code that was absent. Absence is exactly
what a source-level test catches, on any machine, in milliseconds.

The end-to-end proof is separate and already recorded: seed=7 produced
byte-identical output across three runs (99,840 samples, identical hash) and
seed=-1 did not.
