"""The training learning rate must be one value, not four.

WHAT THIS PROTECTS. The rate was defined independently in four places -
train_lora.py's CLI, the API request model, the UI input, and
batch_train_lora.py - and they disagreed: the first three said 5e-6 and only
batch_train_lora said 1e-6. Every adapter in the library that works was
trained through the one that said 1e-6.

THE EVIDENCE, measured 2026-08-06 over five adapters and two conditions:

    5e-6   2 of 2 ran away. 163.8 seconds of audio for a 7.3 second line, on
           every render, hitting the token ceiling and never emitting an end
           of speech.
    1e-6   3 of 3 stopped correctly, median duration 1.01x, 0.87x and 0.94x
           the human reading, in English, Japanese and Chinese.

WHY A TEST AND NOT JUST A FIX. Training loss does not show the failure - the
runaway adapters reached 2.9 and 3.4, which look ordinary - so a drifted
default is invisible until a full training run and the generation run after it
have both been spent. Four independent copies of a number will drift again;
this asserts they cannot.

The two Python entry points now import the constant, so they cannot disagree.
The UI input and batch_train_lora.py cannot import it - one is HTML, and the
other deliberately imports no third-party module at top level - so they are
checked by reading them.
