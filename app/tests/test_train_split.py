"""Training must not consume the validation split.

WHAT THIS PROTECTS. The dataset builder writes 180 train / 20 val with zero
overlap, and also a root metadata.jsonl holding all 200. `train_lora.py` loaded
the root file unconditionally, so every adapter was trained on its own
validation set - 67 of 75 in the library record num_samples=200.

Nothing failed. The split was right there, correct, and ignored. The cost is
that no adapter in the library can be honestly evaluated: every line available
to test it with has already been seen, so a good score proves only that the
model can repeat its own training data.

WHY A TEST AND NOT JUST THE FIX. The failure is invisible from the outside. A
contaminated adapter trains normally, reports a normal loss, and produces
plausible audio. The only symptom is a number that is too good, months later,
in a document that does not know it is wrong.

Paths inside all three metadata files are relative to the DATASET ROOT, which
is why the fix can change only which file is read.
