"""A character's voice must be one draw for the whole book.

`generate_lora_voice` ignored the seed field entirely until 2026-08-04, so
every line of every LoRA voice was an independent draw of that voice. The user
identified it by ear as "multiple narrators" before any metric did - the same
instability had been measured twice and misfiled twice.

Fixing the plumbing made the field WORK. It did not make anything SET one:
70 of 71 characters in the shipped config still carried "-1", so a character's
voice was still redrawn per line, now deliberately rather than accidentally.
These tests cover the assignment side.

Measured, for scale: seeded generation is byte-identical across fresh
processes; unseeded, one adapter's pitch moves across a 32.4 Hz median band,
which is wider than the gap between many distinct voices in the pool.
