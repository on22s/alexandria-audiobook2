"""tts.py must not hand back audio it has not looked at.

THE ASYMMETRY THIS CLOSES. `project.py` validated audio when assembling chunks
into an export. `tts.py`, the layer that CREATES the audio, called sf.write and
returned - eleven `os.path.exists`/`getsize` checks and no decoding. A guard in
the assembly layer while the generating layer is unguarded is worse than no
guard: the pipeline looks protected.

Every generation path - lora, clone, custom, design, and the three batch
variants - funnels through `TTSEngine._save_wav`, so the check belongs there
rather than in seven callers that would drift apart. These tests assert that
funnel property as well as the checking, because if a future path writes
directly the coverage silently disappears.
