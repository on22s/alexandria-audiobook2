"""Tests for character trait inference used in voice casting.

The defect these guard against was measured on the live book, not imagined:
a character's own dialogue was treated as evidence about that character, but
the gendered words someone SPEAKS describe whoever they are talking about.

    Subaru, 412 lines: 46 feminine tokens vs 27 masculine
                       ("she" x20, "her" x11, "girl" x10)
                       -> classified FEMALE

Same for ROM and Reinhard; Emilia came out male. The signal is inverted for
precisely the characters who speak most, and it fed a soft penalty in
get_voice_allocation that pushed correct-gender voices down the ranking.

Determining this properly needs coreference - which pronoun refers to whom -
so the fix is to stop guessing from the wrong text and return "unknown", which
every consumer already handles as "do not filter, do not penalise".
