"""Build and merge speaker-attribution judgement batches for an external judge.

The gold set is the only instrument in this project that has been reliable, and
what made it trustworthy was two independent readers agreeing at 94-97% with
every disagreement falling on lines whose true answer is not a character. This
scales that protocol: emit batches a large model can judge, merge them back with
validation, and report concordance when two judges have seen the same lines.

    build   sample lines from a book and write judgement batches
    merge   validate filled batches and write a gold fixture
    agree   compare two judges' answers and list only their disagreements

Design choices that come from things which went wrong:

- Lines whose normalized text repeats in the book are excluded. Such a line
  cannot be aligned to one position, and scoring it at each occurrence counts
  one judgement several times - a bug that reached two separate harnesses.
- Context is taken from the segmented entries themselves, in reading order, not
  by searching the source text. A source search failed on 35 of 50 lines when
  it was tried; the segmented text is byte-frozen from the source and exact.
- Batches are small. An earlier 147-line request was truncated by the judge at
  row 85, and the loss was invisible until the ids were counted.
