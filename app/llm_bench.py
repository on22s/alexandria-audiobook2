"""Benchmark an OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint to find the concurrency level
(simultaneous in-flight requests) where throughput stops improving.

Single-request decoding leaves most GPUs mostly idle - the fix is sending
multiple requests at once, not making one request faster. This module finds
how many is "at once" for a given endpoint/model/hardware combination, so
review_script.py and find_nicknames.py can use real concurrency instead of
sending batches one at a time.

Standalone use: `python llm_bench.py --model <name> [--base-url ...]`
