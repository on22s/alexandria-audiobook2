"""Choose the reference clip a LoRA dataset will be anchored to.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `train_lora.py` extracts the speaker embedding from ONE
reference clip and uses it for every training sample, per the official Qwen3-TTS
fine-tuning approach. The dataset builder chose that clip as `ref_index = 0` -
whatever sample happened to be first - and nothing checked it against the rest
of the dataset.

Measured across the 75 shipped adapters on 2026-08-07:

    correlation(reference matches its dataset, adapter quality) = +0.76
    reference mismatched (<0.3):  7 adapters, 6 of them poor  (86%)
    reference matching:          67 adapters, 9 of them poor  (13%)

A mismatched reference makes an adapter 6.4x more likely to fail. The worst
case, `husky_baritone_20s_m_anime`, was anchored to a clip scoring **-0.026**
against its own dataset - actively not that speaker - and produced an adapter
scoring 0.004. A representative clip scoring 0.882 was sitting in the same data.

THE MEDOID IS THE FIX. The medoid is the clip most similar to all the others,
so it is representative by construction and robust to a minority of bad clips -
which is the failure mode, since a dataset with a few misdiarized clips still
has a clear majority speaker. Across 74 datasets the medoid beat the existing
reference by a median of +0.07, and by more than 0.15 on 14 of them.

DEGRADES RATHER THAN BREAKS. The speaker model lives in the sibling
interpreter, not in `app/env`. When it is unavailable this returns None and the
caller keeps its existing behaviour, because making dataset creation
hard-depend on a second environment would be a worse failure than an
occasionally poor reference. The caller logs which path was taken.

0.705 -> 0.597, and its medoid scored only 0.49 - the lowest in the batch. On a
dataset where even the most representative clip is mediocre, replacing an
existing reference that happened to be good makes things worse.

So a medoid this weak is reported but not recommended: the caller keeps what it

the point - returning the latter as though it were the former is how a fix
