"""Restore characters a broken decode replaced with U+FFFD, where it is safe.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FILE. index18 carries 6,662 U+FFFD - 1.40% of it - and the
source gate refuses the book, so it is excluded from every goal that measures
on it. The content is not lost. The file was decoded with the wrong codec and
every non-ASCII character became the replacement character:

    the author?s imagination        an apostrophe
    ?Hee-hee??                      opening and closing quotes
    coup d??tat                     an apostrophe AND an e-acute

THE THIRD EXAMPLE IS WHY THIS IS CONSERVATIVE. The corruption is not confined
to quotation marks. Accented letters, ellipses and dashes were destroyed the
same way, and a rule that assumed "every U+FFFD is a quote" would silently turn
the e in "coup d'etat" into a quotation mark - replacing a lost character with a
confidently wrong one, which is worse than leaving it visible.

So this repairs only patterns that admit one reading, and leaves everything
else untouched and counted. A run that repairs 90% and reports the other 10%
is the correct outcome; a run that repairs 100% would be guessing.

THE ORIGINAL IS NEVER MODIFIED. Output goes to a new file, and every
substitution is written to a report so the mapping can be reviewed before the
result is trusted.

    decision this function gets to make.
