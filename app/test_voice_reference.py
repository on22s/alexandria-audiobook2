"""The reference clip must represent the dataset it anchors.

WHAT THIS PROTECTS. `train_lora.py` extracts the speaker embedding from ONE
reference clip and applies it to every training sample. The dataset builder
chose `ref_index = 0` - whatever came first - and never checked it.

Measured across the 75 shipped adapters:

    reference mismatched (<0.3):  7 adapters, 6 of them poor  (86%)
    reference matching:          67 adapters, 9 of them poor  (13%)

6.4x more likely to fail, correlation +0.76 with adapter quality. The worst
case was anchored to a clip scoring -0.026 against its own dataset - actively
not that speaker - while a 0.882 clip sat unused in the same data.

The tests use a stubbed similarity function. What is under test is the
SELECTION LOGIC and its refusal behaviour, not the speaker model: whether the
medoid is identified, and whether an unavailable model degrades to "no opinion"
rather than to a confident wrong answer.
