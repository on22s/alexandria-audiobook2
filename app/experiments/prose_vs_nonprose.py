"""Is Qwen3-TTS worse on non-prose, independently of length and of symbols?

The bullet-list defect is fixed: `normalize_for_speech` turns U+2022 into a
sentence break, and the segment that produced 24.2s of non-speech now scores
52 of 52 words on three consecutive runs. But that fix addresses SYMBOLS, and
the failing segment had two things wrong with it at once - it was full of
bullets AND it had no sentence structure. Fixing one does not clear the other.

Evidence the structural half survives: in the 60-segment baseline the ISBN
segment failed with digits dropped, and it contains no symbol the normaliser
touches.

THE CONFOUND, and why this is not just "generate front matter and count". Front
matter is SHORTER than prose and full of numbers, so a naive comparison would
report a length effect or a digit effect as a structure effect. Segments are
therefore matched into pairs of similar length, one from each class, and only
matched pairs are compared. The baseline already showed length running the
other way - longer segments scored BETTER - so an unmatched comparison would
have been actively misleading.

CLASSIFICATION is by explicit inspectable signals rather than position in the
book, because "first N chunks" is not a property a generator can act on:

    non-prose   short fragments ending in periods with no clause structure,
                high digit or capital density, publisher/rights vocabulary
    prose       ordinary narration and dialogue

Both classes are generated WITH the normaliser active, so a difference that
survives is structure, not symbols.

CORRECTION, 2026-08-03, after the run. The result below is real but MUCH
NARROWER than "non-prose fails". Auditing the 25 segments the sampler actually
chose:

    18 of 25 are near-duplicates of ONE line - "Identifiers LCCN 2016031562
       ISBN 9780316315302..." - repeated across Re:Zero volumes
     2 of 25 are not book text at all, but LLM quality-rejection messages that
       leaked into scripts/*.json
    ~5 genuinely distinct texts underlie all 25 "samples"

So the measured 56-point gap says IDENTIFIER AND ISBN STRINGS FAIL BADLY. It
does not establish anything about non-prose or structure in general, because
the class was five texts replicated rather than 25 independent draws, and the
effective n is nearer 5 than 25. The headline was stated wider than the data.

Two fixes are needed before this claim can be widened: deduplicate near
identical texts in the sampler, and exclude entries that are machine output
rather than book text. Neither is done here; this docstring is the correction.

READINGS, fixed before running:

  non-prose much worse    structure is a real, separate failure mode and the
                          symbol fix was half a fix. Front matter needs its own
                          handling - most simply, not being sent as one chunk.
  no difference           the bullet was the whole story and the fix is
                          complete. Front matter is safe as it stands.
