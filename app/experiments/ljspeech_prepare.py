"""Split a public-domain audiobook into a LoRA training set and a held-out test.

WHAT THIS UNLOCKS. Every voice-similarity number in this repo compares
generated audio to `ref_sample.wav` - the same clip that was also the
generation prompt. That is close to circular, and it cannot answer whether the
output sounds like the character SHOULD sound, because nothing knows what the
line should sound like.

LJSpeech does: a human read every line. So for any held-out line there is a
paired comparison - same text, same speaker, human against generated - which is
a different kind of evidence from anything else in results_index.csv.

THE SPLIT IS BY SOURCE WORK, NOT BY CLIP, and that is the whole design.
LJSpeech clip ids look like `LJ042-0153`: book 042, utterance 0153. A random
clip-level split puts LJ042-0152 in train and LJ042-0153 in test - consecutive
sentences from one recording session, same paragraph, same breath. The model
would be scored on material adjacent to what it memorised, and every number
would come out too high with nothing to indicate it.

Splitting whole books apart means the test lines were recorded in a different
session, on a different subject, and the narrator's rendering of them was never
seen.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT DO. It does not resample. LJSpeech is 22.05 kHz and
this project generates at 24 kHz, so a comparison would be measuring the
resampler as much as the model. `ljspeech_build.py` handles that once, for
both sides, so that human and generated audio always share a rate.
