"""Does what Qwen3-TTS actually emits match the text we asked it to say?

Nothing in this project inspects generated audio. tts.py and project.py have no
transcribe-back, no word-error check, no truncation detection, and no retry on a
bad segment. Every gate is upstream, on text. Whatever the model emits ships.

That is a gap with no measurement attached, and the measurement is cheap because
whisper.cpp is already built in this repo and its model is on disk - integrated
for the preparer and otherwise idle.

THE METHOD. Generate a segment, transcribe it back, align the transcript to the
source word by word, and count the errors. A segment fails when errors exceed a
threshold that scales with length, because one wrong word in six is a defect and
one in two hundred is ASR noise.

WHAT MAKES THIS USABLE RATHER THAN NOISY. A naive comparison fails constantly on
correct audio: ASR writes "twenty five" for "25" and homophones for names. So a
mismatch is only counted when it survives normalisation of numbers, punctuation
and case. The residual false-positive rate is itself reported - a gate nobody
trusts is a gate nobody keeps.

THE SECOND QUESTION IT SETTLES. tts.py's external clone path passes
max_chunk_chars=200; generate_lora_voice passes no cap at all, and the local
Qwen3TTSModel.generate_voice_clone does no internal splitting (verified: no
chunk or split logic in its source). On grimgar03, 12.6% of segments exceed 200
characters and 5.2% exceed 500. If long segments truncate or drift, word-error
rate against length shows it, and --by-length reports exactly that. This turns
an argument about a magic number into a measurement.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. Word errors measure CONTENT, not quality. A segment can score
perfectly and still be flat, mispronounced, or in the wrong voice. This catches
dropped, repeated, hallucinated and truncated speech, which are the failures
that make an audiobook unusable rather than merely imperfect.

Idea credit: zeropointnine/tts-audiobook-tool (MIT), whose validator established
transcribe-back with a length-scaled threshold as the shape of this check. The
alignment here is an independent implementation over stdlib difflib. No code
taken; see THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md.
