"""How much of the error is the roster, and how much is the model?

Two numbers have sat next to each other unreconciled since the start of this
investigation: the generated roster contains the right name for about 85% of
lines, and the model picks the right name about 30% of the time. That gap is
where "selection not recall" came from - the information is present and not
used. But the 85% has never been varied, so nobody knows what the model would
do with a better one.

Today put a number on the roster's failures for the first time: ten characters
across four books that `build_roster` never found, including HITOGAMI with 9
lines in mushoku16 and OUGI with 10 in owarimonogatari3. Those are not walk-on
parts, and every line they speak is unwinnable for a roster-constrained model.

ARMS, same production path, differing only in the roster handed to pass 2:

    generated   what build_roster produces - what ships today
    augmented   generated plus the names the judges found it missing, which is
                the fixture's `roster_additions`. Buildable in practice: a
                second pass over the text, or a better extractor.
    gold        exactly the speakers that appear in this book's gold, and
                nothing else. NOT shippable - it uses the answer key - and it
                exists to bound the whole roster dimension.
    inflated    gold plus twenty plausible decoys drawn from other books. Also
                not shippable; it separates "a longer list is harder" from
                "the right names being present is what matters".

READINGS, fixed before running:

  augmented ~ generated      the missing names are too rare to matter, and
                             roster recall is not where the loss is
  augmented >> generated     roster extraction is worth fixing, and the size of
                             the gain says how much
  gold >> augmented          even a perfect roster leaves most of the gap, so
                             the ceiling is selection, not recall - the
                             original hypothesis, now measured
  inflated ~ gold            list length is not the problem, presence is
  inflated << gold           the model is distracted by size, which would make
                             a SHORTER roster an intervention worth testing

The decoys are drawn from other books in the corpus rather than invented, so
they are real character names of the same kind - a made-up name might be
rejected on style alone and would flatter the inflated arm.
