"""Does attributing a whole exchange at once beat attributing each line alone -
and if it does, is it the ORDER that helps or just seeing the lines together?

Where this comes from. Blind adjudication of the rows every model fails found
twenty cases of unmarked alternating dialogue where the models do not guess
randomly, they converge on the WRONG TURN: all nine runs answered MOGUZO where
the answer was RANTA. 64% of grimgar03's gold lines abut another spoken segment
with no narration between them. Production attributes batches of 25 entries
independently and never sees its own decisions.

The obvious fix - hand the model the previous speaker - was tested and did
nothing. `committed_history` moved accuracy by exactly zero rows with the TRUE
previous speaker supplied free (63.5% none, 63.5% oracle). That result is what
makes this experiment worth running rather than redundant: sequential state was
not the missing ingredient, so if turn-taking structure is usable at all it has
to be used jointly - assigning a whole exchange as one interdependent set,
where "these two alternate" can constrain both ends at once.

THE CONTROL IS THE POINT. A joint arm that beats independent decoding proves
almost nothing on its own, because it changes two things simultaneously: the
model sees more text at once, AND it sees the lines in order. The shuffled arm
holds the first constant and destroys the second - identical lines, identical
scene, identical prompt shape, presented in a fixed-seed random order and
mapped back by explicit line ids.

Readings, fixed before running:

  chrono > independent AND chrono > shuffled   order carries usable signal;
                                               sequential/joint decoding is the
                                               fix and the alternation pattern
                                               is exploitable
  chrono ~ shuffled, both > independent        co-presentation helps, ORDER does
                                               not; ship joint decoding but drop
                                               the turn-taking story entirely
  both ~ independent                           co-presentation adds nothing;
                                               the alternating-error pattern is
                                               a symptom, not a lever - retire
                                               this line of attack
  shuffled > chrono                            suspect the id mapping before
                                               believing it

Scoring is restricted to gold lines, but the model attributes every line in the
scene: a joint decision that only had to cover the scored lines would not be
the joint decision production would make.
