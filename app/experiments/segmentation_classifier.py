"""Can a classifier catch misfiled narration where the rules could not?

`segmentation_filter` established the rules are unusable: `cut` catches 39.1% of
misfiled rows at a 3.66% false-positive rate on real dialogue, and a dropped
line is silence where a character spoke. A learned model is the remaining
approach.

FIRST, A CORRECTION THAT CHANGES WHAT IS POSSIBLE HERE. The brief and
`segmentation_filter`'s own docstring describe "the 839 NOT_DIALOGUE labels".
That is wrong. 839 is the number of JUDGED ROWS; only **46** of them are
NOT_DIALOGUE, against 793 real speech. The positives are also concentrated:

    index18            21        owarimonogatari3   18
    mushoku16           3        grimgar03           4
    grimgar06           0        mushoku18           0

So two of six books contain 39 of the 46 positives and two contain none at all.

WHY THIS IS RUN ANYWAY. The point is to measure whether the labels can support
the model, not to produce an accuracy. The decision this informs is whether to
spend judging time on more NOT_DIALOGUE labels, and that decision needs the
power limit stated in numbers rather than asserted.

EVALUATION IS LEAVE-ONE-BOOK-OUT, because the deployment question is whether a
classifier trained on labelled books works on an UNLABELLED one. Random k-fold
over pooled rows would train and test on the same book and report a number that
does not survive contact with a new one. Books with no positives are scored for
false positives only - they can refute a model but cannot confirm it.

THE OPERATING POINT IS FIXED IN ADVANCE at a 1% false-positive rate on real
dialogue, and recall is read at that point. Choosing the threshold after seeing
the curve is how a 6% false-positive rule gets reported as promising.
