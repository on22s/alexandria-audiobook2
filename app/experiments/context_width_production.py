"""Does the w4 context gain survive the PRODUCTION path?

The diagnostic sweep put w4 at +6.2 points over w1 (p=0.022) on grimgar03, and
production pass 2 supplies w1. The reviewer's answer to that was: gate it first,
because `because` looked like +10.8 in a diagnostic harness and reversed to -7.2
through `attribute_batch`. This is that gate.

Both arms run through `attribute_batch` with the shipping prompt, batched at 25,
identical in every respect except the width of the neighbour text. Production
passes `{"previous_context": seg[i-1], "next_context": seg[i+1]}`; the w4 arm
passes the same two keys with four segments merged into each. Because
`attribute_batch` spreads `neighbor_contexts[i]` straight into the batch JSON,
**the prompt contract is unchanged** - the model sees the same fields, with more
text in them. That isolation is what makes this a width test rather than a
prompt test, and it is the distinction that made `thinking` a fair experiment
and `because` an unfair one.

Both books, because the diagnostic result is grimgar03 only and every
single-book result in this investigation has needed a second book. Per the
review: if Grimgar reproduces and Mushoku does not materially regress, w4 is
ready for a guarded production switch.

Note on what this does NOT test: choosing width per line from the true
speaker's mention distance is an ORACLE policy using information unavailable in
production. The diagnostic stratification suggested it; bounding it needs a
separate oracle-adaptive arm, and building it needs a detector that sees only
roster names, tags and scene state.
