"""Pitch range (goal 2.5) and voice quality (goal 2.6) at a usable sample size.

WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM voice_compare_view. That module owns the
measurements - `pitch_stats` and `voice_quality` - but its CLI renders an HTML
comparison view, one figure per line with the audio embedded. Asking it for a
hundred lines produces a 209 MB page and no numbers. GOALS.md cites the
functions as the probe for 2.5 and 2.6, which is accurate, and running the
script is not the same thing as calling them. This is the missing CLI.

WHAT IT REPORTS, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO. Both goals are about PRESERVATION: how
close the generated take sits to the same human speaking the same line, not
whether the number is good in isolation. A jitter of 0.02 means nothing alone;
0.02 against a human's 0.04 on the identical sentence means the synthetic voice
is half as unsteady as the person it imitates, which is the tell that a voice
is too clean. So every measure is reported as a paired (human, generated)
median plus the ratio between them, and no measure is reported for a clip where
either side failed to voice - dropping the pair, never substituting a zero,
because a zero here would read as perfect steadiness.

Paired clips come from the `*_generate.json` manifests already on disk, so this
generates no audio and needs no GPU beyond what librosa and praat use.
