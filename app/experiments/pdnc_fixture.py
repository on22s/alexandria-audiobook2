"""Turn PDNC novels into fixtures, so generalisation stops needing a person.

Every result in this investigation rests on 772 rows across four light novels,
all translated, all contemporary. Whether the adapter's +5.4 is a property of
the adapter or of that corpus has been the largest open risk, and I repeatedly
described testing it as blocked on someone hand-labelling a fifth book. That
was wrong: the Project Dialogism Novel Corpus already carries speaker-attributed
quotations for 28 public-domain novels.

WHAT PDNC GIVES THAT OUR OWN GOLD DOES NOT.

  quoteType     Explicit / Implicit / Anaphoric per quotation. Pride and
                Prejudice is 26% explicit and 50% IMPLICIT, so this is not the
                soft benchmark classic prose sounds like - and it allows
                stratifying results by how much attribution cue exists, which
                our own fixtures never labelled.
  Aliases       curated per character, replacing alias groups we assembled by
                hand and repeatedly got wrong.
  Category      major / intermediate / minor, replacing the 5%-of-lines
                frequency proxy used for "lead character".

WHAT IT DOES NOT TEST. PDNC annotates quotations in raw novel text, so this
measures ATTRIBUTION only and bypasses segmentation entirely. It says nothing
about the misfiling problem, and a book where every quotation is already
delimited is an easier world than the segmenter's output.

LICENCE. The novels are public domain; the repository declares no licence for
the ANNOTATIONS. Fine for internal evaluation, unresolved for anything shipped.

# PDNC MARKS NON-CHARACTERS WITH A LEADING UNDERSCORE, and this builder did

# character_info.csv, present in 21 of the corpus's 28 novels but absent from
# PrideAndPrejudice and TheSignOfTheFour - which is why the first fixtures
# looked clean and the fault stayed hidden until the Austen books were built.
#
# Two distinct harms, and only the second changes a score:
#   roster  the model was offered `_GROUP` and `_UNKNOWABLE` as candidates in
#           some books and not others, so a cross-book comparison was partly a
#           comparison of roster contents. TheAwakening carries them and is one
#           of the three books behind the 89.1% author-held-out result.
#   gold    MansfieldPark had 16 rows whose expected_speaker WAS `_GROUP` or
#           `_UNKNOWABLE`: unanswerable rows scored as ordinary ones.
#
# Matched by name rather than by prefix would have been the fragile choice -
# a 22nd novel may add a fourth marker - so the prefix is the rule and
# test_pdnc_fixture_excludes_pseudo_speakers pins both halves.
