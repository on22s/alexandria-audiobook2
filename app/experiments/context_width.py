"""Is attribution context-starved rather than model-limited?

Production pass 2 shows the model ONE segment either side of the line it is
attributing. The diagnostic harness shows four. Measured prompts are 176 tokens
median against a 16384-token window - about 1.1% utilisation.

Meanwhile the error analysis says 62.1% of errors have no character name
anywhere nearby, 12.6% name the person being addressed rather than the speaker,
and only 6.8% had a speech-verb tag the model missed. Those are the symptoms of
a model that cannot see enough text, not one that cannot reason about it.

Six models spanning 4x in parameter count and four architectures all land
between 45.6% and 55.4% with no significant separation. A plateau that flat
across model choice is more consistent with an input limit than a capability
limit - which makes context width the cheapest untested explanation.

Arms: the SAME line, the SAME roster, the same decoding, varying only how many
neighbouring segments are supplied.

    w1    one segment either side   - what production actually does
    w4    four either side          - what every diagnostic in the ledger used
    w15   fifteen either side
    w40   forty either side         - approaching whole-scene

If accuracy is flat across these, context is not the constraint and the plateau
needs another explanation. If it rises, production is leaving points on the
table for free, since none of these come close to filling the window.

Runs against llama.cpp by default: it is ~11% faster than LM Studio on identical
work here, and unlike crossover.py this harness never calls
ensure_ideal_settings, so it will not fight an externally managed server for
control of the model.
