"""Can a rule catch the misfiled segments without eating real dialogue?

`segmentation_eval` showed the segmenter sends narration to TTS as character
speech - 17.5% of index18's judged rows, 10.0% of owarimonogatari3's - and that
the failures are two distinct shapes:

    sentence cut in half     a segment ending mid-clause whose successor starts
                             lower-case: "Summoning magic" / "and the magic
                             recorded on the Dragon Race wall art"
    paragraph misfiled       plain third-person narration marked SPOKEN:
                             "A shallow cut opened in William Orwell's side."

Both look mechanical, so this tries rules before anything heavier. The two
judges' labels make it self-scoring - no review, no adjudication, just
precision and recall against gold - across 839 judged rows, of which 46 are
NOT_DIALOGUE and 793 are real speech. (An earlier version of this docstring
called it "the 839 NOT_DIALOGUE labels", conflating the row count with the
label count; the positives are 46, and `segmentation_classifier` shows that
number is the binding constraint.)

THE TRADE-OFF IS THE WHOLE POINT. A filter that flags everything reaches 100%
recall and destroys the corpus. Real dialogue wrongly dropped is worse than
narration wrongly kept, because a dropped line is silence where a character
spoke, while a kept one is a misattributed line the cascade might still fix.
So the headline number here is FALSE POSITIVES on the 772 rows the judges gave
a real speaker, and recall is only interesting subject to that staying near
zero.

Each rule is reported alone and in combination, because a rule that only fires
where another already fired is not worth its risk.
