"""If contiguity is worth 16.6 points, do batch BOUNDARIES matter?

`batch_contiguity` established the mechanism behind the largest lever in this
investigation: a batch of 25 consecutive segments beats 25 scattered ones by
16.6 points (p=1.4e-07) at the same prompt size. The model attributes a
conversation better than it attributes isolated lines.

Production cuts a new batch every 25 segments regardless of where conversations
begin and end. So a run of turn-taking that straddles a boundary is split, and
both halves get a weakened version of the scattered condition - some of their
conversation is in the other batch. Nobody has tested whether that costs
anything.

TWO ARMS:

    fixed       windows of 25 consecutive sendable segments - production today
    aligned     windows built by packing whole RUNS of consecutive spoken
                segments, never splitting one, up to the same size budget

Both arms are contiguous; both send the same kind of prompt; both score the
same rows. The only difference is where the cuts fall.

READINGS, fixed before running:

  aligned >> fixed    boundaries matter and production is losing accuracy to an
                      arbitrary cut. A cheap, shippable change.
  aligned ~ fixed     the model recovers enough from the neighbour contexts it
                      already gets, and 25-segment cuts are fine. Closes the
                      lever that batch_contiguity opened.
  aligned << fixed    packing whole runs produces less uniform batches and the
                      size variance costs more than the alignment buys - check
                      the batch-size spread before concluding anything else.

BATCH SIZE IS REPORTED PER ARM. Aligned windows cannot all be exactly 25, and
batch size is itself worth points, so a difference in mean size is a
confounder. If the aligned arm's mean size drifts far from 25, its result is
about size as much as alignment and must not be read as alignment alone.
