"""Two questions about knowing when NOT to ask the model.

**1. Does two-pass agreement predict CORRECTNESS, or only agreement?**

The cascade routes on disagreement between two cheap passes, and that routing
demonstrably works - escalating those rows buys points. But nobody has checked
the thing that makes an abstention policy possible: when the two passes AGREE,
how often are they right? The model answers UNKNOWN on 0-1.1% of lines, so
today every uncertain line becomes a confident wrong guess and the pipeline has
no way to say "leave this one alone".

If agreement is strongly predictive, then on disagreement the system could fall
back to something safer - the previous speaker, or the narrator - instead of
guessing. If agreement predicts nothing, abstention is dead and the disagreement
signal is only useful for deciding what to escalate.

**2. How far do rules alone get you?**

`get_deterministic_named_entry` already resolves some lines with no LLM at all.
The fraction has never been reported. Every line a rule can settle is faster,
free, and cannot hallucinate a name - and the precision of those rules against
gold is the number that says whether leaning on them harder is safe.

Both are computed from artifacts and fixtures already on disk. No GPU, no
model, no new inference.
