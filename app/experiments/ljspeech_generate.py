"""Generate the held-out lines the human already read, in every arm.

Consumes `ljspeech_build.py`'s output. For each held-out line there is human
audio of that exact sentence, so this is a paired comparison rather than a
similarity score against the generation's own prompt.

ARMS, and what each one is for:

    lora        the trained adapter
    clone       zero-shot from the same reference, no training
    ceiling     NOT generated - the human reading a DIFFERENT held-out line
    floor       NOT generated - a different narrator entirely

The last two are the reason this experiment is worth running. `clone_vs_lora`
reported cosine 0.664 against 0.634 and nobody could say whether 0.664 was
good, because there was no scale. The ceiling is how similar audio gets when it
genuinely IS the same person on different material; the floor is what
"different voice" scores. A generated number only means something between
them, and the anchors cost no GPU time - they are pairings of audio that
already exists.

Everything is seeded. Unseeded, one adapter's pitch moves across a 32.4 Hz
median band, which is wider than the gap between many distinct voices - so an
unseeded arm would be measuring the draw, not the method.
