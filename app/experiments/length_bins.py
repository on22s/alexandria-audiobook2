"""Does the fixture flatter the models, or penalise them?

§13.8.2 of the addendum proved a mismatch and then asserted a direction it had
not measured: the scored rows are longer than the population of spoken lines,
and I wrote that this "skews the flattering way" on the reasoning that longer
lines carry more evidence. That reasoning is exactly the kind that has gone 0/3
in this investigation. The mismatch is a fact; the direction is a measurement,
and this is the measurement.

Two numbers come out of it:

  raw          accuracy on the rows we actually scored - every number in the
               ledger, including the ~50-70% "plateau"
  reweighted   the same per-bin accuracies, reweighted to the length
               distribution of ALL spoken lines in the book

If reweighted < raw, the fixture flatters and the plateau is optimistic. If
reweighted > raw, it penalises. If they agree within their intervals, the
mismatch exists but does not matter, which is a real result and the one that
would let §13.8.2 stand as written.

Standing assumption, stated because it is the load-bearing one: reweighting
assumes accuracy within a length bin is the same for scored and unscored lines.
That is not verifiable without labelling more lines. What it buys is that
length can no longer be the explanation - any residual bias has to run through
some other property that correlates with length inside a bin.
