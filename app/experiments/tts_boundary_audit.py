"""Goal 5.1: what actually reaches the TTS engine with no spoken form.

THE MISSING MEASUREMENT. 5.1 has a source-level baseline - counts over the
input `.txt` files - and records "At the TTS boundary: still NO BASELINE." The
source gate proves the app can refuse bad input; it says nothing about what
survives the journey to the speaker, which is a different question with a
different answer, because `get_speech_normalization` sits in between and
rewrites some of it.

WHERE THE BOUNDARY ACTUALLY IS. Every voice path in `tts.py` - clone, lora,
design, ensemble, custom - calls `normalize_for_speech(text)` as its first
statement inside `generate_voice`. That single call is the boundary, so this
audits its OUTPUT rather than the script text. Auditing the input would
re-measure the source-level baseline that already exists and would blame the
normaliser for characters it removes.

WHAT COUNTS AS UNSPEAKABLE. Not "non-ASCII" - that would flag every accented
name and all the CJK in a Japanese book, which are speakable and are the point.
The test is Unicode general category: symbols (So/Sm/Sk), private use (Co),
unassigned (Cn), and the replacement character U+FFFD, which is not a character
at all but the residue of a decoding failure. Letters, marks, digits,
whitespace and punctuation are left alone in every script.

The corpus is the 82 saved books in `scripts/`, which is what this app has
actually been asked to speak, rather than a constructed sample.
