"""Does the model assume speakers alternate when they do not?

owarimonogatari3's base 14B scored 40.1% against a previous-speaker floor of
50.0%: worse than repeating the last speaker. `trivial_baselines` found 50 of
its 63 measured arms below that floor, and `committed_history` found the TRUE
previous speaker worth +9.3 there while the model's own prior answer cost 3.1.

All three point at one mechanism: the model changes speaker more often than the
text does. This measures that directly, with no GPU.

THE METRIC IS THE CONTINUATION RATE - P(this line has the same speaker as the
previous one). Gold has a true value per book; every arm has its own. If the
predicted rate is systematically below gold, the model over-alternates, and a
continuation bias is the indicated fix. If it matches, over-alternation is the
wrong explanation and the below-floor result needs another one.

ADJACENCY IS TEXTUAL, NOT ROW-ORDER. Scored rows are a subset of segments, so
two consecutive rows in the fixture can sit far apart in the book with
narration between them. Counting those as adjacent would measure the sampling
of the fixture rather than the turn-taking of the text. Only pairs separated by
at most `--max-gap` segments count, and the pair count is reported so a book
with few genuine adjacencies is visible rather than silently thin.

READINGS, fixed before running:

  predicted << gold      the model over-alternates; a continuation prior is
                         indicated, and it explains the below-floor scores
  predicted ~ gold       over-alternation is not the mechanism, and the
                         below-floor result on owarimonogatari3 is caused by
                         something else - most likely wrong names on correctly
                         grouped lines, which cluster_vs_name can already see
  predicted >> gold      the model under-alternates, sticking to one speaker
                         through genuine turn changes
