"""Does hiding character NAMES make attribution better or worse?

SPC (EMNLP 2023 Findings) reports 94.6% in-domain accuracy on Chinese novels
with a fine-tuned RoBERTa-large, beating GPT-3.5-turbo zero-shot. A core piece
of its method is SYMBOLIZATION: every character name in the passage and the
candidate list is replaced by [C0], [C1] ... before the model sees it, so the
model cannot lean on name priors or on explicit "Tom said" patterns and has to
reason from who is present and who is addressing whom.

That is a prompt-level change, testable in this pipeline without adopting their
model, and it targets a defect already measured here: `offbyone_turns` found
57% of wrong predictions name a character who does not speak anywhere within
+-3 lines - the model reaching for someone not in the room.

TWO ARMS over the same rows, same model, same contexts:

    names      roster and context exactly as production sends them
    symbols    every roster name replaced by [C0].. throughout the roster, the
               target line and both neighbour contexts; the answer is mapped
               back for scoring

WHAT EACH OUTCOME WOULD MEAN.

  symbols better   the model is being distracted by names - leaning on
                   familiarity or on surface patterns rather than structure -
                   and symbolization is a cheap production change
  symbols worse    names carry real signal here (gender, honorifics, who a
                   name suggests), and stripping them costs more than the
                   distraction it removes. SPC's gain would then be about
                   their training regime rather than the representation
  no difference    the representation is not what limits this pipeline, and
                   the SPC result comes from fine-tuning rather than from
                   symbolization

A CONFOUND STATED UP FRONT. SPC symbolizes AND fine-tunes on symbolized data.
Applying symbolization to a model that never saw it in training tests only half
their method, and a loss here does not refute the technique - it would show it
needs the matching training, which is exactly what their fine-tuned encoder has
and this 14B does not.
