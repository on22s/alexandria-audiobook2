"""Label the whole corpus from noisy rules, without ground truth.

Segmentation is blocked on labels: 46 NOT_DIALOGUE examples is what made the
classifier underpowered (21.7% recall, a 25-point interval). Hand-labelling
scales linearly with a person's time.

Snorkel's insight is that it does not have to. Write several noisy LABELLING
FUNCTIONS, estimate each one's accuracy from HOW THEY AGREE WITH EACH OTHER -
which needs no labels at all - then combine them into a probabilistic label per
item. A function that agrees with the consensus often is trusted more; one that
fires alone is trusted less.

This implements that directly rather than taking the dependency: the estimator
is about forty lines, and a library would bring a modelling framework for a
problem with eight functions and two classes.

THE LABELLING FUNCTIONS, each returning +1 (narration misfiled), -1 (real
speech), or 0 (abstain). They must be genuinely different sources of evidence,
because the accuracy estimate comes from disagreement - eight copies of one
rule would look unanimous and be confidently wrong.

VALIDATION IS HONEST HERE. The 839 judged rows exist already, so the weak
labels can be scored against real judgements the model never saw. Weak
supervision is a way to spend a person's time better, not a way to avoid
measurement: if the probabilistic labels are wrong, this says so.
