"""One definition of "is this the right speaker", for every harness.

Eighteen harnesses in this directory each define their own `same()`. They agree
today because they were copy-pasted, which is exactly the situation Rule 15
warns about: two independently-maintained copies of one decision will drift,
and the drift is invisible because both keep producing plausible numbers. This
module is the single copy.

It also fixes a scoring bug the copies all share. Across every artifact in the
ledger, 268 of 21,190 wrong rows are not wrong:

    punctuation only       162   MR. PRIEST vs MR PRIEST, MS. SHORT HAIR
    romanization variant   106   ARUMANFI vs ALMANFI, RUDIUS vs RUDEUS
    genuinely different  20,922

The 162 are a period. `same()` upper-cased both sides and compared, so a model
that wrote the honorific with its full stop was marked wrong for it. That is a
defect in the instrument, not a finding about models, and it is folded into the
primary comparison here.

THE 106 ARE DELIBERATELY NOT. `attribution_accuracy.romaji_key` documents why
and the reasoning still holds: exact spelling measures whether a name is usable
downstream, because a misspelled speaker fragments the cast list and breaks
voice assignment, while phonetic matching measures whether the model identified
the right character. Those are different questions, and the penalty is
model-specific - magistral-small loses 7.9 points of oracle accuracy to
romanization where three other models lose nothing. Folding it into the primary
metric would hide a real, unevenly-distributed weakness. `same_speaker` reports
it separately so a caller can have both numbers.

# ASCII-ONLY ALLOW-LISTS DELETE ENTIRE WRITING SYSTEMS. The previous pattern
# was `[^A-Z0-9 ]`, which kept latin letters, digits and space and dropped
# everything else AS PUNCTUATION - so every CJK name normalised to the empty
# string, `same_speaker` hit its `if not b: return False` guard, and every
# Chinese row scored wrong. Measured on the WP2021 arm: 0 of 380 correct,
# with `expected` and `predicted` byte-identical on the rows it refused.
# The real figure is 260 of 380.
#
# Now a DENY-list of punctuation, so any script's letters survive: hanzi,
# kana, hangul, cyrillic, and accented latin (JOSÉ kept its É rather than
# becoming JOS). `_` is removed explicitly because \w keeps it.
#
# This can only make normalize MORE discriminating, never less, so the
# docstring's promise - that it must not merge distinct characters - is
# strengthened rather than weakened. Verified behaviour-identical on English:
# re-scoring the stored RiQuA and PDNC arms gives exactly the same totals.
