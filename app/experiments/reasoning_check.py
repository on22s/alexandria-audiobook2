"""Does a model's own justification reveal when its answer is wrong?

The observation this comes from: judging owarimonogatari3, gemini answered
UNKNOWN on two rows while its own `reasoning` field named Ougi Oshino
outright - "the speaker (Ougi Oshino) is missing from the roster". The answer
was wrong and the reasoning was right, in the same response. Index18's LESSER
is a third instance.

That is the "selection not recall" pattern again: the roster contains the
right name 85% of the time and the model picks it 29.9%. If the reason field
carries information the answer field loses, a cheap consistency check between
them is an error detector.

WHY THIS IS NOT THE `because` EXPERIMENT. `because` asked whether justifying
improves the answer and the answer is no - it lost 7.2 points on the
production path. This asks whether the justification DETECTS a wrong answer,
which does not require it to improve anything. A model that reasons correctly
and then emits the wrong name is exactly what we want to catch, and that is
the case `because` scored as a failure.

MEASURED ON THE JUDGES FIRST, and it was weak there: across 1043 rows from two
frontier judges, accuracy was 97.9% where the reasoning confirmed the answer
and 95.5% where it named only other people - 2.4 points of separation on
overlapping intervals. But those judges are 96-99% accurate, so there is
almost no error to detect, and most mismatches were the reasoning mentioning
an ADDRESSEE ("his leap toward Hachikuji") rather than making a competing
claim. Neither of those objections applies to a 14B model at ~55%.

THE BAR IT HAS TO CLEAR. The disagreement cascade already routes on a signal
that separates 78.2% from 51.6% at 40% coverage - but it costs TWO cheap calls
to compute, because it compares w1 against w4. A reasoning-consistency flag
costs ONE. So it does not need to beat the cascade's separation, only to earn
its place at half the price:

    separation >= ~15 points at <= 40% coverage   worth routing on
    separation < 5 points                         the judges' result holds at
                                                  every capability level and
                                                  this line closes
    high separation but tiny coverage             a precision instrument with
                                                  no reach, like the confidence
                                                  signal that died at 17%

Arms: `plain` is the shipped prompt; `reasoned` adds a because-style field.
Accuracy of `reasoned` is expected to be WORSE and that is not the finding -
the finding is whether its mismatch flag sorts right from wrong.
