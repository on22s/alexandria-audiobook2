"""Should method selection be per BOOK or per SECTION?

Four interventions now split the same way, and the split is large:

                        grimgar03   mushoku16
    w4 context            +10.5       -5.0
    batch size peak         50          25
    tag-priority           +6.5       -5.8

The natural next step is to route per section rather than per book, since a
battle scene and an interior monologue want different treatment even inside one
novel. Both books do contain both regimes - grimgar03 has tag-poor windows and
mushoku16 has tag-rich ones - so there is room for it in principle.

TWO CANDIDATE FEATURES WERE TESTED AND NEITHER SUPPORTS IT.

Local tag density (speech verbs in adjacent narration, +-12 segments):

                    grimgar03   mushoku16
    tag-poor <25%     +15.4       -6.4
    mixed 25-60%       +4.1       -4.5
    tag-rich >60%      +9.0       (n=1)

Uniformly positive in one book and uniformly negative in the other, at every
band. Grimgar's tag-poor windows - the ones that most resemble mushoku - still
gain 15 points.

Local first-person density (pronouns per 1000 narration words):

                       grimgar03   mushoku16
    3rd-person <20        +6.7      -19.4
    mixed 20-45           +4.8      -11.1
    1st-person >45         0.0       +1.1

This one is stranger. The two books behave OPPOSITELY in third-person windows,
which is the reverse of what "third-person prose carries tags" would predict.
The one consistent row is the last: in first-person passages tag-priority does
nothing in either book.

WHAT THAT LEAVES. Per-section routing on either feature would pick the wrong
method about as often as the right one, so the shipping decision is per book.
The one section-level rule the data does support is negative and narrow: turn
tag-priority OFF in first-person passages, where it buys nothing anywhere.

A caution on mushoku16's third-person windows, the -19.4 cell: in a book that
is 62 first-person pronouns per 1000 words, a window with fewer than 20 is
unusual, and the likeliest candidates are the letter and diary passages -
written text with names but no speech tags, which is exactly where a
tag-priority rule should misfire. That is a hypothesis, not a measurement; it
needs the epistolary sections marked before it can be tested.
