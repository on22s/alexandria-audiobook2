"""Does telling the model to trust an adjacent speech tag over everything else help?

This one comes straight out of a labelling failure rather than a hypothesis.
Adjudicating grimgar03's keep-assault scene, the wide-context judge got 19 of
19 wrong in a single way: it took names from surrounding prose instead of from
the attribution tag sitting immediately beside the line.

    "We'll do it, too!"
    -> "Mr. Pleasant, the guy who seemed to be the leader of Choco's PARTY, said"
    judged CHOCO

    "You're doing fabulous!..."
    -> "Bri-chan was shouting things like that"
    judged CHOCO

Nine of nineteen went to CHOCO, who speaks none of them. A frontier model with
twelve segments of context lost to a four-segment window because the extra
context supplied more candidate names, not more evidence.

If a judge with the whole scene makes that mistake, the production model at w1
is at least as exposed - and unlike the judge, it cannot be given more context
to fix it, because more context is what caused it. The remedy is a rule, not a
window: an adjacent tag OUTRANKS every other kind of evidence.

ARMS, differing only in the system prompt:

    baseline    the shipped attribution prompt
    tagfirst    the same, plus an explicit precedence rule - if the segment
                immediately before or after names someone with a verb of
                speech, that person is the speaker, whatever else the passage
                suggests

WHERE IT SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT WORK, registered before running. Adjacent tags
are what speech-verb density measures, and the books differ nearly fourfold:
grimgar03 62.5%, mushoku16 27.1%. So a real effect should be LARGER on
grimgar03. A uniform gain across both books would suggest the sentence is doing
something generic rather than exploiting tags, and a gain on mushoku16 alone
would contradict the mechanism outright.

The risk is a model that follows the rule too literally and attributes a line
to whoever is named nearby even when the tag belongs to a different line - the
same failure the rule is meant to prevent, relocated. Errors are therefore
reported split by whether the target actually has an adjacent tag: a gain
confined to tagged rows is the rule working, a loss on untagged rows is it
misfiring.
