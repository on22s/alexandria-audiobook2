"""Score generated audio against the human reading of the same line.

Deliberately NOT mean_f0. Measured 2026-08-04: declared pitch carries 12.9 Hz
mean error against a 32.4 Hz within-voice spread, so a mean over one line
cannot separate two voices. The pitch comparison here is the CONTOUR, aligned
in time - two readings of a sentence differ in pacing, and averaging throws
away the shape that carries the prosody.

METRICS

    ecapa       speaker-embedding cosine. Runs under the sibling interpreter,
                which has speechbrain; app/env does not, and its absence
                silently degrades to acoustic distance - the substitution the
                whole test plan forbids. Handled by scoring in a separate
                process rather than importing.
    f0_corr     Pearson correlation of log-f0 contours after DTW alignment.
    dur_ratio   generated / human seconds. Instruction wording alone moved
                duration 1.36-1.43x, so pacing is known to be movable.
    mcd         mel-cepstral distortion, the standard TTS timbre metric, so
                results are comparable to published work and not only to us.

ANCHORS ARE THE POINT. `human_vs_human` pairs each held-out line with a
DIFFERENT held-out line by the same narrator: the ceiling, how similar audio
gets when it genuinely is one person. Without it, "cosine 0.66" means nothing -
which is exactly the state clone_vs_lora was left in.
