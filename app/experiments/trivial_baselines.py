"""What does each book score for free, before any model runs?

`owarimonogatari3` was found to collapse to the frequency prior at 36.9% while
other books sit between 1.2% and 17.3%. That number has been quoted as a
property of the book, but the floors themselves were never computed, so a 55%
on one book and a 55% on another have been compared as though they meant the
same thing. They may not.

Four baselines, none of which reads a single line of text:

    majority        always the most frequent speaker in the book
    alternate       strict alternation between the two most frequent speakers,
                    which is what a two-hander conversation looks like
    previous        the speaker of the previous scored line - the "no speaker
                    change" baseline
    round_robin     cycle through the book's speakers in frequency order, as a
                    control that is structured but carries no information

BASELINES ARE COMPUTED ON THE SAME ROWS THE HARNESSES SCORE - single-occurrence
lines with a real speaker - so they are directly comparable to every accuracy
in the ledger rather than to a different denominator.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. A model beating `majority` by two points on a book whose
majority is 37% has demonstrated almost nothing; the same two points over a 5%
floor is a different claim. This does not measure any model. It measures how
much of each book is free.
