"""Does a justification field still help on the production path?

The reasoning arms measured `because` at +10.8 points, p=0.004 - the first
significant positive architectural result in this investigation. But that
harness called the model directly with a simplified prompt and scored its own
baseline at 39.6%, while the production path through attribute_batch scores
49.6% on the same lines. The gain was measured against a baseline ten points
below what production already achieves, so it may not survive.

That is the same error this investigation kept making with negatives, applied to
a positive: the instrument was not the thing being shipped.

Every arm here runs through attribute_batch with the production prompt, so the
only difference is the system prompt and the output schema.
