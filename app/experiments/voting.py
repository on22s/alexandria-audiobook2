"""Does majority voting beat greedy - and is its confidence a routing signal?

`attribute_batch_voted` has been in the codebase the whole time and appears in
none of this investigation's results. It samples the same batch once per fixed
seed at temperature 0.3 and takes the per-entry majority, returning the winning
share as a confidence. Two separate questions, and this measures both:

  ACCURACY   does the majority beat greedy on the production path?
  SIGNAL     does a split vote mark a line the pipeline got wrong?

The second question matters as much as the first because of what was measured
offline today: routing the 40% of rows where w1 and w4 disagree to a 70B took
grimgar03 from 67.5% to 74.2% (p=0.0006) at 40% of the big model's calls. That
router needs TWO cheap runs at different widths. A split vote would be a
cheaper trigger from a single configuration - if it separates right from wrong
as well. The comparison is stated in those terms rather than as "is voting
confident", because a confidence that is high everywhere is useless for
routing no matter how well calibrated it looks.

Earlier notes in `majority_vote` cite 81% greedy/unanimous agreement against
42% on split votes, measured on mushoku16 before this fixture and harness
existed. Those numbers are not comparable to anything in the current ledger,
which is the reason to re-measure rather than cite them.

Arms:

    greedy   votes=1, byte-identical to the shipped path
    vote3    three seeds, majority
    vote5    five seeds, majority

Cost is linear in votes, so vote5 has to earn a 5x bill. Pre-registered: a gain
under 3 points is not worth 5x on a book-length run, whatever its p-value.
