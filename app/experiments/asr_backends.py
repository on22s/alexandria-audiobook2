"""Which ASR backend should the preparer transcribe audiobooks with?

THE DECISION THIS INFORMS. `alexandria_preparer_rocm_compatible.py` slices an
audiobook into training clips for Voice Lab. Two things matter and they are not
the same:

    WER               did it hear the right words
    ALIGNMENT ERROR   did it put the boundary in the right place

Only the second decides whether a backend can replace the align step. A clip cut
30ms early clips a consonant off every sample in the dataset; a clip cut 300ms
late carries a word from the next line into the training data. WER says nothing
about either, which is why a benchmark that reports WER alone would pick the
wrong winner.

WHY THE ALIGNMENT TEST IS SYNTHETIC. LJSpeech clips are single utterances with
no internal boundaries, so they cannot score alignment on their own. This
concatenates known clips into one file with **exact** boundary times, then asks
each backend to recover them. Ground truth is arithmetic, not annotation - the
one case in this repo where the answer key cannot itself be wrong.

WHAT IS BEING COMPARED. Backends the preparer can actually select, plus
SenseVoice as a candidate (github.com/QwenAudio/SenseVoice) whose claim is 5x
faster than Whisper-Small at better Chinese accuracy. Claims are the vendor's;
this measures them.

READ THE SPEED NUMBER CAREFULLY. Backends here run on different stacks - a GGML
binary, a torch pipeline - so a speed difference is a difference between
*implementations on this machine*, not between model architectures. Reported
because the preparer's throughput is what a user waits on, not as a statement
about the models.

        large-v3  CER 14.1%  align 826 ms   20% within 300 ms

    base is the better SEGMENTER by a factor of ten and the worse TRANSCRIBER
    by a factor of three. Since the preparer needs both - clip boundaries to
    cut on, and text to train against - and since the two jobs are separable,
    nothing requires one model to do both.

    So base decides where the clips are, and large-v3 is asked what was said
    inside each one. Each model is used only for the thing it measurably wins.

    WHAT WOULD FALSIFY THE IDEA. large-v3's transcription advantage might come
    partly from choosing its own segment boundaries - a model given a window it
    did not pick could transcribe worse than it does alone. If the hybrid's CER
    lands near base's 44.3% rather than large-v3's 14.1%, that is the answer,
    and the hybrid is not merely unhelpful but wrong about why large-v3 wins.
