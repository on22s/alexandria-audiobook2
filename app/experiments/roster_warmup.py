"""Does pass 2 lose accuracy because the roster is built as it goes?

An experimental harness that supplied the complete final roster scored 35.6%
where production scored 29.9%. Production admits characters incrementally, so
early batches cannot select someone not yet established. That is a hypothesis,
not a finding - the harness also differed in retry handling and in never
carrying partial roster state - so this measures it directly.

Arms, identical frozen segmentation and decoding:

  incremental  roster grows batch by batch, as production does
  warm         roster discovered in a first pass, complete before scoring
  oracle       every gold answer's speaker, plus the discovered roster
               (diagnostic only - an upper bound on roster availability)

Reported by book position as well as overall. A roster effect must concentrate
in the first quartile, because that is where an incremental roster is most
incomplete. A flat gain means something else differs between harness and
production, and that must be found before shipping a two-pass design.
