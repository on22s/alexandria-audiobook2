"""Three analyses that consume existing artifacts and need no GPU.

The review's recommended order puts these ahead of any new sweep, on the
grounds that the next useful information comes from decomposing what we already
measured rather than adding another row to an unresolved model table. All three
run against committed artifacts, so they can execute while the GPU is busy and
cannot disturb anything.

  1. ORACLE ERROR STRATA (review priority 6)
     The 24-34% failure rate when the true speaker is among five candidates is
     the least explained number in the ledger. Recall does not explain it, nor
     roster size, nor model size. This buckets those errors by a mechanical
     proxy for cause and separates errors where strong models AGREE - which are
     the ones most likely to be bad gold rather than model failure.

  2. FIXTURE REPRESENTATIVENESS (review priority 7)
     The fixture was random at construction, but ambiguity and unique-text
     filters change the evaluated population afterwards. If the scored rows are
     enriched for hard lines, the ~50-70% range describes a filtered subset and
     not representative dialogue - which would make the "plateau" an artefact of
     what we chose to measure.

  3. SELECTIVE-THINKING ROUTING FEATURES (review priority 1)
     `thinking` is the only intervention with a significant production result
     and its blocker is cost, not effect. Routing needs only correlation with
     difficulty, a far lower bar than the acceptance-criterion confidence signal
     that failed at 17% coverage. This labels every paired row RESCUE / HARM /
     NEUTRAL and reports which cheap features separate them.

Nothing here decides anything. Each section reports what the existing data can
and cannot support, and names the experiment that would settle it.
