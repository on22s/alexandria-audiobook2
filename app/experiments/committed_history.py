"""Does supplying the previous speaker help, and can we supply it accurately?

Everything measured on 2026-07-27 converges here. Blind adjudication of the 26
grimgar03 rows that EVERY model run fails with the true speaker among five
candidates found three causes: four contested gold labels, two rows of an
undeclared alias, and **twenty rows of unmarked alternating dialogue**. On
those twenty the models do not guess randomly - they converge on the WRONG
TURN. All nine runs answered MOGUZO where the answer was RANTA; eight answered
RON for RANTA; eight answered SHIHORU for MOGUZO.

64% of grimgar03's gold lines sit directly against another spoken segment with
no narration between them, so turn-taking is the only available evidence on
most of the fixture. Production pass 2 attributes batches of 25 entries
INDEPENDENTLY and never sees its own prior decisions.

FOUR ARMS. A two-arm test conflates two questions, and a three-arm one leaves
the answer unbuilt:

    none        no history                    - what production does today
    oracle      TRUE previous speaker         - is the representation useful?
    predicted   this run's own prior answer   - can we supply it well enough?
    gated       own answer, only where a second pass agrees - can we supply it
                well enough SOMETIMES, and is that enough?

The gated arm was added after the first run's null was found to be a pooling
artifact. Per book the oracle is worth +9.3 on owarimonogatari3 and +3.7 on
mushoku16 while predicted costs ~3 on both: the representation works and the
state source fails. The gate supplies history only where the no-history pass
independently agrees, trading coverage for correctness with no gold, so a win
is shippable.

Readings, fixed before running:

  oracle helps, predicted does not  - the representation is useful and the state
                                      source is not; work on the state source
  both help                         - production candidate
  neither helps                     - retire simple sequential history; the next
                                      candidate is joint scene decoding, which
                                      exploits turn-taking without committing an
                                      early error as immutable state
  predicted helps more than oracle  - almost certainly a bug; investigate before
                                      believing it

The `scaffold` arm already asked the model to INFER `previous_speaker` and lost
4.0 points. That is not this experiment. Asking a model to introspect is not the
same as handing it state, and the distinction is the whole point.

ERROR PROPAGATION is measured, not assumed: the predicted arm is decoded in
book order so a wrong answer becomes the next line's history, and accuracy is
reported by distance from the last narration anchor. If early mistakes
compound, that shows up as decay with distance.
