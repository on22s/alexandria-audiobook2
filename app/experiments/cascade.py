"""Live test of the disagreement cascade: cheap model twice, big model on the splits.

Priced offline from artifacts already collected, the rule looked like the best
result of the investigation:

                  cascade   w1 alone   70B everywhere   70B calls
    grimgar03      78.0%      57.0%         79.2%          40%
    mushoku16      65.5%      49.6%         66.9%          60%

Within 1.2 points of running the big model on everything, on both books, for
40-60% of its calls. The mechanism is sharp: on rows where the cheap model's w1
and w4 answers disagree, the cheap model scores 25.5% and the 70B scores 77.6%.
Disagreement does not merely mark hard rows, it marks rows where capability is
the thing missing.

WHY THIS RUN EXISTS. That table is a SIMULATION over arms that were executed
independently, at different times, on two machines. Every number in it is a
real measurement of a real model on the same row, and the routing rule uses no
gold - but nothing has ever executed the cascade as one pipeline. This does,
end to end, deciding routing from answers produced in this run only.

The comparison that matters is against the simulation, not against w1: if the
live result lands near 78%/65.5%, the offline pricing method is validated and
can be trusted for the next design. If it does not, the simulation was wrong
about something, and finding out which part is worth more than the cascade.

TWO PHASES, because a 70B at 43 GiB and a 14B cannot be resident together.
Phase `cheap` runs w1 and w4 and writes the routing decision to a state file;
phase `expensive` reloads with the big model and attributes only the routed
rows. A production batch run would do exactly this - collect the hard lines,
then make one expensive pass - so the split is faithful rather than a
concession.

Both phases go through `attribute_batch` with the shipping prompt at w1
context. w4 exists here ONLY as half of the disagreement detector: the 70B gate
showed w4's answers are worse than w1's on both books, so the cascade keeps w1's
answer wherever the two agree and never keeps a w4 answer at all.
