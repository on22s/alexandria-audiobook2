"""Are the only two interventions that work ADDITIVE, or do they fix the same rows?

Two things have survived a production-path test in this whole investigation:

    thinking   +9.7 on qwen3-14b (p=1e-5), +5.0 on qwen3-32b (p=0.035),
               -1.0 on magistral-small (p=0.42) - real, but model-dependent
    w4 context +10.5 on grimgar03 (p=0.0002), -5.0 on mushoku16 (p=0.39) -
               real on one book, a regression on the other

Everything else - `because`, `scaffold`, closed-6 candidates, committed
history, roster warmup, adaptive width - was flat or harmful. So the question
of what to ship is really a question about these two, and nobody has run them
together. The 2x2 is the whole experiment:

              no thinking      thinking
    w1        the incumbent    +9.7 measured alone
    w4        +10.5 measured   never run

Readings, fixed before running:

  w4+thinking ~ w1 + both deltas   INDEPENDENT: they fix different rows, and
                                   the combination is the production target
  w4+thinking ~ the better single  REDUNDANT: both are proxies for the same
                                   missing evidence; ship the cheaper one and
                                   stop looking for more of the same
  w4+thinking < either alone       INTERFERENCE: worth knowing before anyone
                                   ships them together on the strength of two
                                   separate measurements
  interaction differs by book      the honest likely outcome given w4 already
                                   reverses sign between books; would mean the
                                   decision is per-book, not global

Additivity is judged on the interaction term, not on whether the top-right
cell is the biggest number. Two interventions that each add 10 points to a
57% baseline cannot both add 10 points to each other's output without
overlapping, and the test is whether the observed combination beats what
independence predicts.

Same production path as the w4 gate: `attribute_batch` with the shipping
prompt, batch 25, exhausted batches scored as failures rather than dropped.
Thinking is `reasoning_effort=None` against `"none"` - the same isolation
`because_production` used, changing the decoding and nothing about the prompt.
