"""Durable record for an attribution experiment.

Aggregate tables cannot support an architecture decision: a later reader cannot
tell a real result from a prompt, roster, alias, indexing or scoring difference.
Every run writes its environment, its exact inputs, and one record per scored
line, so any number in a report can be recomputed from the artifact.

Process idleness is recorded from LM Studio and the app's own state, not
inferred from a process search - `pgrep -f` matched its own command line three
times during the 2026-07-26 experiments and gave the wrong answer each time.
