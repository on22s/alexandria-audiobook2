"""Does a freshly trained adapter actually sound like its narrator?

THE FAILURE THIS GATES. Five adapters in the shipped library resembled nobody -
0.027, 0.061, 0.099, 0.397, 0.404 speaker similarity against the narrators they
were trained on, where a working voice reaches ~0.73. All five recovered on a
retrain, two of them to ~0.67. The voices were recoverable the whole time and
nothing said otherwise.

WHY LOSS CANNOT DO THIS JOB. Final loss on the 0.027 adapter was 4.07. Across
the entire 75-adapter library loss sits at ~4.1 regardless of whether the voice
works. It is blind to this failure, so training "succeeding" means nothing.

The sibling gate `verify_adapter_stops` catches a different defect - adapters
that never stop generating - and the same shape works here: generate a handful
of lines, measure, refuse. Neither is visible without generating audio.

WHY HELD-OUT CLIPS. Scoring against training clips measures memorisation. The
dataset builder writes a 180/20 split and `train_lora.py` now honours it, so
the val clips are genuinely unseen and this is a real test rather than a
recital.

THRESHOLD. Default 0.45. Measured reference points from the library:

    working adapters        0.65 - 0.74
    the five failures       0.027 - 0.404
    human vs human ceiling  ~0.83

0.45 sits in the empty band between the failures and the working ones. It is
deliberately generous: the purpose is catching a voice that resembles NOBODY,
not ranking good voices against each other.
