"""Can a router PREDICT the right method per book, or only explain it after?

Every routing claim in this investigation has been fitted: the best arm per
book was read off the results, and the gap to a single fixed method was called
the value of routing. That number is not achievable by anything that has to
decide before seeing the answers.

This evaluates the realizable version. For each held-out book, both the fixed
method and the router's rule are chosen using ONLY the other books, and scored
on the held-out one. Nothing here is allowed to see the held-out book's gold
when making its choice.

    loo-fixed    the arm with the best mean accuracy on the OTHER books, applied
                 blindly. This is what shipping one setting looks like.
    loo-router   1-nearest-neighbour on a book-level text feature: find the most
                 similar other book and copy the arm that won there.
    oracle       the best arm on the held-out book itself. NOT achievable, and
                 present only to bound the gap.

FEATURES ARE COMPUTED FROM THE TEXT, NEVER FROM GOLD - first-person pronoun
density, speech-tag density, dialogue fraction, mean spoken length. A router
using gold-derived features could not run in production, which is the whole
failure this script exists to avoid repeating.

WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW. Four books means four test points per family.
That is enough to show routing FAILING - if loo-router does not beat loo-fixed
across families, the idea is dead on the evidence available. It is not enough
to establish that routing works: a win on four points, each a different book,
would be suggestive and nothing more, and must not be reported otherwise.
`style_routing` already found that two section-level features route the wrong
way, so the prior here is unfavourable.

The honest headline is the oracle gap. If oracle barely beats loo-fixed, there
is nothing for any router to win and the question closes regardless of feature
choice.
