"""Are the hard errors off-by-one turns, or 91 independent hard judgements?

`residual_errors` found the remaining core is 91 LEAD CONFUSIONS - two major
characters swapped, 11.8% of all rows, and the failure a listener notices most.
The question is whether they share a structure.

`committed_history` found something specific that suggests they might: on
unanchored alternating dialogue the models do not guess randomly, they converge
on the WRONG TURN. All nine runs answered MOGUZO where the answer was RANTA;
eight answered RON for RANTA. That is a parity error - the model has the
conversation right and its phase wrong.

If the residual lead confusions are mostly the model assigning line N the
speaker of an ADJACENT line, they are one systematic error rather than 91
independent ones, and a parity correction could address many at once. If they
are not, no structural fix exists and the remaining core is genuinely hard.

FOUR BUCKETS per wrong prediction:

    prev speaker     the prediction is the true speaker of the previous
                     scored line - the model is one turn behind
    next speaker     the true speaker of the following line - one turn ahead
    nearby           the true speaker of some line within +-3, but not
                     immediately adjacent
    unrelated        a character who does not speak nearby at all

A BASELINE IS REQUIRED, because in a two-hander the previous speaker is often
the ONLY other candidate, so "matches the previous line" happens by chance at a
high rate. The same buckets are therefore computed for the CORRECT predictions
too: if wrong answers match the previous speaker no more often than right ones
do, the pattern is the book's structure and not the model's error.
