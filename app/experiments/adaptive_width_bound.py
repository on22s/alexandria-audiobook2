"""Is a per-line context width worth building, before anyone builds it?

The width sweep found w4 best on average and flat past it, and the per-row
stratification suggested picking width from how far the true speaker's mention
sits from the line. The reviewer's objection to that is correct and fatal as
stated: `name_at` is computed from the GOLD answer. A production router does not
know who the speaker is - that is the entire task - so a policy keyed on
`name_at` is not a policy, it is a leak.

This bounds the idea instead of shipping it. Four numbers, from the committed
sweep artifact, no GPU:

  fixed-best        the best single width, applied to every row - the incumbent
  observable        a router using only features a production run can see,
                    scored under leave-one-out so it never picks a width using
                    the row it is being tested on
  oracle-name_at    the leaky policy, kept as a DIAGNOSTIC ceiling for
                    "how good could a perfect difficulty detector be"
  any-width         a row counts correct if ANY width got it right - the
                    absolute ceiling of every possible width policy, perfect
                    detector included

Decision rule, fixed before running:

  observable beats fixed-best by a significant margin   build the router
  observable ties fixed-best, oracle-name_at is high    the ceiling is real but
                                                        needs a detector we do
                                                        not have; the next
                                                        experiment is the
                                                        detector, not the router
  any-width barely beats fixed-best                     there is nothing to
                                                        route to; close the
                                                        line of enquiry

The last case is the one that would kill it outright, and it is checkable
first: if the union over all four widths is only a point or two above the best
fixed width, then the widths are failing on the SAME rows and no policy over
them - however clairvoyant - can do much.
