"""Re-run four negatives under the current, corrected harness conventions.

Every one was recorded before some defect was found and fixed, and a negative
result can be produced by any single break in the chain - the scaffold arm
scored a correct idea at 7.7% on a prompt bug. Re-examining two of the eight
negatives on CPU already found instrument defects in both, so these four get
the same treatment.

  voting     KNOWN broken, not merely suspect. Its prototype called
             build_roster(named[:400]) and ran with a 5-name roster. That was
             recorded at the time as invalidating the result, and the result
             was never re-taken.
  prose      -5.4 pt. Changed the OUTPUT format, which the reasoning arms have
             since shown is the sensitive axis, and drew 2.1 retries per batch
             against 1.4 - a format-instability penalty is exactly what would
             produce a spurious negative.
  narration  -2.1 pt. Same output-format concern; narration rows had to be
             answered and validated, so mislabelling one failed a whole batch.
  narrator   no effect. Measured earliest, before the gold set had aliases and
             before repeated lines were excluded, so its denominator was wrong.

All arms share the frozen inputs, temperature 0, and the same 139 unambiguous
gold lines. Only the manipulation differs.
