"""Does telling the model who narrates rescue first-person books?

`narration_signal` found the cause of the 16-point book gap: the pipeline reads
neighbouring narration to find the speaker, and first-person narration rarely
names anyone. mushoku16's adjacent narration names the true speaker 35.3% of
the time against grimgar03's 77.6%, and both books score the same (43.1% vs
45.0%) on the rows where that signal is absent. The gap is composition over one
feature.

That diagnosis implies first-person books need a signal the pipeline does not
currently use, and it names the obvious one: the narrator is a KNOWN CONSTANT
who speaks a large share of all lines. In mushoku16, Rudeus narrates and 38% of
gold lines are his - the single most predictive fact available about the book,
and nothing in the prompt mentions it.

ARMS (production path, w1 context, batch 25, everything else the shipping
configuration):

    baseline        the shipped attribution prompt
    narrator        the same prompt plus one sentence naming the narrator and
                    noting that unattributed interior lines are usually theirs

Only the system prompt differs, which is the isolation `thinking` had and
`because` did not - `because` also changed the output schema, and that is why
its diagnostic gain reversed in production.

THE CONTROL IS THE SECOND BOOK, and the prediction is asymmetric. If the
diagnosis is right:

    mushoku16 (first-person)   should GAIN - the prior supplies what the
                               narration does not
    grimgar03 (third-person)   should be flat or slightly worse - the narration
                               already names people, and Haruhiro speaks only
                               28% of lines

A gain on BOTH books means the sentence is doing something generic (priming,
extra instruction) rather than supplying a first-person prior, and the
first-person story is not established. A gain on NEITHER retires the narrator
prior and leaves turn-taking and register as the remaining candidates for the
hard regime - both already tested and null, which would make the unanchored
rows genuinely underdetermined rather than merely under-served.

This is the first experiment in the investigation designed from a mechanism
rather than from a list of things to try, so its failure is informative in a
way the earlier prompt sweeps were not.
