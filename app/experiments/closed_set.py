"""Conditional selection accuracy: can the 9B pick from a short list?

Roster recall is 85% and pipeline accuracy is 29.9%, so on 55% of lines the
right name was available and not chosen. This asks whether shrinking the choice
set fixes that, and measures the ceiling with an oracle set.

Run on an idle GPU. Temperature 0, so single runs are exact.
