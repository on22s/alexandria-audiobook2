"""Is three-pass generation better than the single pass that actually ships?

THE MISSING MEASUREMENT. `three_pass_generate.py` exists, has six settings in
config_settings.py, ships three prompt files, and is invoked by nothing:
`/api/generate_script` runs `generate_script.py`. Its own docstring calls it "a
side-by-side alternative... the single-pass path is untouched".

So the repository carries a second generation architecture that has never been
scored against the one in production. That is the gap this closes, and the
answer decides whether the module is wired up or deleted - both are fine
outcomes, and carrying an unmeasured alternative indefinitely is not.

WHAT IS COMPARED. Both paths run over the same source text, at the same
temperature, against the same attribution gold. The metric is speaker accuracy
on gold-labelled lines, which is what the four gold sets exist for.

PAIRED ON LINE ID, NOT POOLED. The two paths segment independently, so they do
not produce the same entries - three-pass may split a paragraph the single
pass keeps whole. Only lines both paths produced AND gold covers are scored.
Comparing different line sets is the asymmetry that has bitten this repo
repeatedly, and here it would be easy to miss because both numbers would look
reasonable.

REPORTED PER BOOK. Book identity dominates method in this project: across ~470
scored arms the median book differs by 19 points before any method is chosen,
and mushoku16 and grimgar03 differ by 24 on the same method. A pooled figure
would mostly measure which books were included.
