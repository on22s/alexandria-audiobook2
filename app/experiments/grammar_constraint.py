"""Does constraining decoding to the roster repair off-list answers?

Measured error class this targets: answers that are not in the candidate list
the model was handed. On mushoku16 magistral-small produced 19 of them in 60
oracle errors (13.7% of all oracle rows), spelling RUDEUS as RUDIUS / RUDIEUS /
RUDUEUS and ALMANFI as ARUMANFI - the right character under a different Japanese
romanization. Other models show 5.0-5.8% on the same arm. On the OPEN arm the
same class is 0.0-1.4%.

A GBNF grammar makes those outputs structurally impossible: the sampler can only
emit one of the supplied names. The interesting question is not whether off-list
answers disappear - they must - but whether forcing a valid choice REPAIRS the
line or merely relabels one error as another. If the model wanted RUDIUS and the
grammar leaves only RUDEUS reachable, that is a repair. If it wanted RUDIUS
because it had the wrong character in mind, the constraint just picks a
different wrong name.

Production relevance: pass 2 currently generates speaker names freely and a
post-hoc is_attested_name gate REJECTS unattested ones - a gate added after
finding 279 invented speakers per book. Rejection discards the answer entirely.
A grammar moves the same check from after decoding to during it, so the model
must pick its best VALID option instead of having its answer thrown away.

What this cannot do: roster recall is 85% while accuracy is 30-60%, so most
errors are picking the WRONG ROSTER NAME, which a grammar permits. The ceiling
here is the invented/misspelled class only.

Arms, all on the same lines and the same server:

  open-free      full roster in the prompt, unconstrained decoding   (as today)
  open-grammar   full roster in the prompt AND as a grammar
  oracle-free    true speaker + 4 distractors, unconstrained         (as today)
  oracle-grammar same 5 names, as a grammar

open is the arm that resembles production; oracle is where the effect should be
largest. Running both tests the mechanism and its production relevance at once.

Requires llama.cpp - `grammar` is a llama.cpp server field, not an OpenAI one,
and is one of the capabilities LM Studio does not expose.
