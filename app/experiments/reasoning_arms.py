"""Is the model's reasoning accounted for anywhere in pass 2?

Three levels of the pipeline currently forbid it: the prompt says "no
explanations", the schema is {n, speaker} with no field for why, and every call
sets reasoning_effort=none. Meanwhile the gold set demands a `reasoning` field
from every judge - we require justification to trust a judgement, then instruct
the pipeline making the same judgement not to explain itself.

A partial probe from 2026-07-24 hints this matters: on the 78 gold lines both
arms covered, thinking-on scored 47.4% against thinking-off's 25.6%, 24 repairs
to 7 regressions, p=0.0033. That probe was never scored for accuracy at the time
- only speed and structural quality - and thinking was switched off on the
strength of a "run-to-run noise floor" that later proved to be GPU contention.

Arms, batched at 25 to mirror production, everything else identical:

  baseline   {n, speaker}, no explanations, reasoning_effort=none  (what ships)
  because    {n, speaker, because}, one clause per line, effort=none
  scaffold   {n, tag, addressed, previous_speaker, speaker} - the questions a
             human judge works through, asked explicitly and in order
  thinking   {n, speaker}, reasoning_effort unset so the model may think
  scaffold_thinking   both - the questions AND permission to reason

The last two arms cross the only two factors that matter, so the result can
distinguish four outcomes rather than two:

  thinking alone wins        - what it needed was room, not direction
  scaffold alone wins        - it needed direction, and thinking is wasted cost
  both together win          - they are complementary; pay for both
  scaffold_thinking is worse - the questions constrain a model that reasons
                               better unprompted, which is worth knowing before
                               anyone writes a prompt like this into production

`because` is the cheap version of the idea: a clause, not a monologue, and a
field that can be inspected, validated and used as a confidence signal. The
candidate-ID experiment removed expressiveness from the output and lost 13.6
points; this adds some back.
