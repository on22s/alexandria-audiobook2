"""Build something to LISTEN to, because WER cannot answer this question.

`instruct_value` compared per-line instructions, per-character instructions and
none at all. Seeded (`instruct_value_seeded.json`, 18 segments, 491 words):

    per_line   0.611% WER, 3 errors, 0 failed, 0 non-speech
    per_char   0.000% WER, 0 errors, 0 failed, 0 non-speech
    none       0.000% WER, 0 errors, 0 failed, 0 non-speech

Three words across 18 segments, all of them in the per-line arm. Beware the
UNSEEDED artifact `instruct_value.json`, which reads 1/1/2 errors and looks
like three identical arms; it was quoted as the seeded result once already.

That settles one thing: instructions do not meaningfully change WHAT is said,
and if anything the per-line arm is marginally worse at it. It settles nothing
about HOW, and delivery is the entire reason instructions exist. A transcript
cannot carry tone, pace, or emphasis - scoring one is measuring the wrong
channel and then reporting a null.

This is the same shape as the pitch mistake earlier today. An instability that
had been measured twice and misfiled twice was identified by the user in
seconds by listening to it.

SO THIS PRODUCES ARTIFACTS, NOT A VERDICT. For each of a few lines carrying a
real emotional instruction, the three arms are rendered at one seed and joined
into a single file with a spoken label before each arm, so the arms cannot be
confused and the file can be played start to finish without a key.

The order is FIXED, not randomised, and that is a deliberate limitation rather
than an oversight: this is an aid to listening, not a blind test. If it turns
out the arms sound different, the follow-up is a proper blind comparison with
the order shuffled and the labels withheld - and that is worth building only
once there is something to hear.
