"""What is left in the quarter of lines the adapter still gets wrong?

The shippable configuration reaches 74.2% pooled. Nobody has characterised the
remaining 25.8%, so every proposal for what to do next is a guess. This sorts
those rows into kinds, because the kinds want different work:

  roster miss        the true speaker is not on the roster the model was given.
                     Unwinnable by any model: the answer was never offered.
                     Fixing it is extraction work, not attribution work.
  alias confusion    the prediction and the truth are the same character under
                     different names, and the alias groups did not catch it.
                     This is a FIXTURE defect - it counts as an error and is
                     not one.
  unanswered         the model returned nothing. A generation or format
                     failure, not a reasoning failure.
  lead confusion     both names are major characters. The listener hears this
                     most, and it is the hardest genuine case.
  minor confusion    at least one side is a walk-on. Real, but nearly
                     inaudible.

WHY THIS AND NOT MORE MODELLING. The three interventions with the best stories
this week - roster quality, scene cast, closed sets - all failed, and they were
chosen from intuition about what the model lacked. This measures what it
actually gets wrong first.

A large roster-miss share would redirect effort upstream to extraction. A large
alias share would mean the ledger's accuracy is understated. A large lead-
confusion share would mean the remaining problem is genuinely hard and no
cheap fix exists.
