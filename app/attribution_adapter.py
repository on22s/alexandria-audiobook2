"""Is the attribution LoRA the server claims to have the one we configured?

WHAT THIS IS FOR. A distilled adapter measured +9.8 points cross-book on all
four gold sets (disagreement 149-73 in its favour) and +14.6 through the actual
deployment path - Q4_K_M base plus f16 LoRA served by llama.cpp. That is three
to six times the run-to-run spread of ~1.6-3.7 points seen on repeated
identical configurations, and it is the largest measured attribution gain in
this project.

The adapter lives in the SERVING layer. `llama-server` is started with `--lora`
and the scale is toggled through `POST /lora-adapters`, so the application does
not change - the server it points at does. What the application must gain is
the ability to say which adapter it expects and to NOTICE when that expectation
is not met.

WHY A LOUD CHECK RATHER THAN A QUIET DEFAULT. Without one, a server started
without the adapter, or with its scale at zero, answers every request perfectly
happily at BASE quality. Nothing fails. The book generates. It is simply 9.8
points worse and no artifact records why. That is the same shape as the seed
bug - a configured field silently ignored - which cost six contaminated
comparisons before anyone noticed by ear.

DELIBERATELY NOT A HARD GATE BY DEFAULT. `require=True` raises; the default
warns and returns the finding. A book half-generated overnight should not die
because a server was restarted without its adapter, but the run must carry the
fact.
