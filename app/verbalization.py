"""Decide what the narrator voices when the source contains unspeakable marks.

The script keeps the source's characters for fidelity; this module decides what
actually reaches TTS. Split by class because the classes need different
handling: a scene break is a pause, an arrow is a word, a music note is a
delivery cue, and a pictographic kana needs a human.

Sizing comes from a scan of 4,195 novels: scene breaks are 105,897 occurrences
against 17,115 for verbalization, and U+2500 alone outweighs every other symbol
combined. See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-25-unspeakable-passthrough-design.md.
