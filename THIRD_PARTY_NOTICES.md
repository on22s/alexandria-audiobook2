# Third-Party Notices

Alexandria Audiobook2 incorporates material from the projects below. Each entry
records what was taken and reproduces the licence terms that require it.

Adding an entry is not optional. MIT and Apache-2.0 both require the copyright
notice to travel with the code; a comment in the source naming the project is
good practice but does not by itself satisfy either licence. If you copy or
closely adapt third-party code, add it here in the same commit.

Projects with **no licence file grant no rights at all** and must not be copied
from, however permissive they look. Reading them for ideas is fine; reproducing
their code is not.

## p0n1/epub_to_audiobook

- Source: https://github.com/p0n1/epub_to_audiobook
- Licence: MIT
- Used in: `app/experiments/quote_aware_chunking.py`

The priority-ordered list of split points in `PUNCT_PRIORITY` is adapted from
that project's `split_long_sentence`. Two properties were the reason to adopt it
rather than write our own: CJK sentence-enders are tried before English ones, so
a language without spaces never falls through to a hard character slice; and
closing brackets and quote marks are themselves split points, so a cut lands
after a quotation closes rather than inside it.

## buddies/alexandria-audiobook (fork of Finrandojin/alexandria-audiobook)

- Source: https://github.com/buddies/alexandria-audiobook — `app/instruct_utils.py`
  and `VOICE_REFERENCE.md` (Xiao Zhang, 2026-09-16..18)
- Licence: MIT (the fork carries upstream's MIT licence file, © 2026 Finrandojin;
  the ported material is the fork author's)
- Used in: `app/experiments/instruct_lexicon.py` (the vocabulary lists, kept
  verbatim), `app/experiments/instruct_audit.py` and
  `app/experiments/custom_voice_instruct_drift.py` (built on them)

The timbre / register / identity, emotion, delivery and pacing term lists,
and the rule that Section-I (timbre) terms belong in a constant character
style rather than a per-line instruct, are ported as written so that a
finding here means what it meant in their measurement. The finding itself
(an explicit rate instruction lengthens CustomVoice takes by +17.9%) is
theirs; ours are in `instruct_audit_20260918.json` and
`custom_voice_instruct_drift__ryan_arc1_20260918.json`.

## Ideas adopted without code

These projects shaped a design but no code was copied from them. No licence
obligation attaches to an idea; they are recorded because the provenance is
worth keeping, and because if we later lift code from one of them, the entry
above is where the obligation gets written down.

| Project | Licence | What it prompted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [zeropointnine/tts-audiobook-tool](https://github.com/zeropointnine/tts-audiobook-tool) | MIT | Transcribe-back validation of generated audio: word-error alignment against the source with a length-scaled fail threshold, plus truncation detection. Implemented independently in `app/experiments/tts_output_validation.py`. |
| [DrewThomasson/VoxNovel](https://github.com/DrewThomasson/VoxNovel) | MIT | That BookNLP is the field-standard baseline for quotation speaker attribution, and that our ledger had never measured against it. See `app/experiments/booknlp_baseline.py`. |
| [nazdridoy/kokoro-tts](https://github.com/nazdridoy/kokoro-tts) | MIT | Voice blending by weighted interpolation as a way to widen a cast's voice pool. See `app/experiments/voice_blending.py`. |
| [WhiskeyCoder/Qwen3-Audiobook-Converter](https://github.com/WhiskeyCoder/Qwen3-Audiobook-Converter) | MIT | An independent choice of a 200-character chunk cap for Qwen3-TTS voice cloning, matching the cap our own external path enforces and our local path does not. |
| [Darkkingwill/alexandria-audiobook](https://github.com/Darkkingwill/alexandria-audiobook) | MIT | Five UX fixes rebuilt on our own patterns, not merged (#534, 2026-09-11): cancellable merge/export, and the Result-tab affordances around it. |
| [aayushnaphade/alexandria-audiobook](https://github.com/aayushnaphade/alexandria-audiobook) | MIT | Reviewed 2026-09-18 alongside the buddies fork; nothing copied. |
| Michel, Epure, Cerisara — the quotation-attribution prompt formulation behind `michel`, `michel2`, `michel2_full`, `michel2_shot` (`app/attribution_prompt_variants.py`) | paper | The prompt shape that won on every base measured (RECIPES §"Prompt variants × bases"); our variants are re-writings of the idea, no text copied. |
| [CosyVoice](https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/CosyVoice) | Apache-2.0 | Design notes only — `docs/LEARN_FROM_COSYVOICE.md`. |

### Consulted and rejected

Recorded so the same repositories are not re-reviewed from scratch.

| Project | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| sudonitin/Audio-book-generator | No licence file — no grant of rights. |
| aedocw/epub2tts-chatterbox | No licence file — no grant of rights. |
| devsapp/ai-audiobook-flow | No licence file — no grant of rights. |
| OmniVoice-Studio, QuickPiperAudiobook | AGPL-3.0; copyleft reach is a poor fit for a shipped application. |
| transitive-bullshit/kindle-ai-export | Solves acquisition, not narration; drives the Kindle web reader with Playwright, which raises terms-of-service questions for no technical gain. |
| ReadAlongs/Studio | Licence is unresolved (`NOASSERTION`), and our preparer alignment already works. |
| aedocw/epub2tts, DrewThomasson/ebook2audiobookpiper-tts, pravinyo/AudioBook | Nothing structurally absent from this project. |

## Research and industry practice consulted

No code or text is taken from these; they are recorded because they changed
design decisions, and a decision whose reasoning cannot be traced is one that
gets re-argued from scratch. Where a finding contradicted something already
built, that is noted - those are the entries worth keeping.

### Audiobook casting

- [How Professional Audiobook Narrators Voice Characters — Jay Myers](https://www.jaymyersvoiceover.com/blog-ideas/how-audiobook-narrators-make-characters-sound-distinct-believable-and-consistent)
- [How to Give Every Character a Different Voice in Your Audiobook — Audie](https://www.audie.ai/how-to-give-every-character-a-different-voice-in-your-audiobook)
- [Narrator Voice vs Character Voices — Audie](https://www.audie.ai/narrator-voice-vs-character-voices-getting-dialogue-right)
- [Character Voices in Audiobooks: 7 Key Considerations — Malk Williams](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/character-voices-audiobooks-7-key-considerations-malk-williams)
- [Creating Distinct Character Voices for Audiobooks — Vois](https://vois.so/blog/character-voices-audiobooks)

Two findings changed the design:

**4-8 distinct character voices plus a narrator is the working maximum; more
risk listener confusion.** This CONTRADICTS the direction the voice-blending
experiment was heading. `voice_blending.py` measured that blending an 8-voice
pool reaches 148 identities and framed that as the prize. By professional
practice 148 is far past the point where a listener stops tracking who is
speaking. The arithmetic in that experiment stands; the goal it implied does
not.

**Contrast matters between characters who SHARE SCENES, not globally.**
Narrators pick voices so that characters appearing together are
distinguishable. Measured on the live book: 69% of character pairs never
co-occur within a 20-line window, and a greedy colouring of the co-occurrence
graph needs only 9 voices for 32 characters. So `audible_errors.py`'s
assumption - that any two characters sharing a voice is a confusion - is
stricter than practice. Sharing is fine when the characters never meet.

### Anime and dub casting

- [Answerman — Why Do Dubs Cast Men As Boy Characters, while Japan Casts Women? (ANN)](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2018-08-22/.135762)
- [Cross-Dressing Voices / Anime (TV Tropes)](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CrossDressingVoices/Anime)
- [How Are English Dub Voice Actors Cast? (ANN)](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2015-09-11/.92806)
- [Anime Voice Acting: From Start to Finish — Bunny Studio](https://bunnystudio.com/blog/voice-acting-anime-from-start-to-finish/)

Adult women routinely voice boys and young men in Japanese originals - Naruto,
Edward Elric, Luffy, Ash - because few adult men sound convincingly young and
child actors bring scheduling and content limits. This matters for a corpus of
translated light novels: an `_f_` adapter on a teenage boy is CONVENTION, not
an error. It corrected a conclusion about Subaru, where the real mismatch was
the `50s` age band rather than the `f` tag.

### Voice and perceived sexual orientation

- [The effect of sexual orientation on voice acoustic properties (Frontiers in Psychology, 2024)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1412372/full)
- [Speech Acoustic Features: Gay Men, Heterosexual Men, and Heterosexual Women (PMC)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7497419/)
- [Do gay-sounding men speak like women? — Smyth & Rogers (TWPL)](https://twpl.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/twpl/article/download/6168/3157/0)
- ["Do I Sound Straight?" — Acoustic Correlates (JSLHR)](https://pubs.asha.org/doi/abs/10.1044/2018_JSLHR-S-17-0125)

Checked because the folk model - "sounds more feminine, so higher pitch" - was
about to be encoded. The literature does not support it. Findings on mean pitch
are mixed and sometimes reversed; the reliable correlates are ARTICULATORY,
chiefly /s/ with higher spectral peaks and longer duration, longer voice-onset
times, and more alveolar /l/. One study reports sibilant variation as socially
rather than anatomically determined. Nothing here is representable by an
`_f_`/`_m_` tag, which is further evidence that the sex tag is the wrong
primary key for casting.

## Speech corpora for ground-truth voice evaluation

Added 2026-08-05, before use rather than after. These provide something no
measurement in this repo previously had: a human reading the *same line* a
model was asked to generate, so voice similarity can be scored against ground
truth instead of against the reference clip that was also the prompt.

### LJSpeech (The LJ Speech Dataset)

- <https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/>
- 13,100 clips, ~24 hours, a single speaker, 22.05 kHz.
- **Public domain.** The recordings come from LibriVox and the texts from
  seven non-fiction works in the public domain via Project Gutenberg.
- Used as the primary single-narrator corpus: one speaker across many hours is
  exactly the shape a voice LoRA is trained for.
- Note for anyone reusing our numbers: at 22.05 kHz it needs resampling to the
  24 kHz this project generates at. We resample the HUMAN audio once, up
  front, so both sides of every comparison share a rate.

### LibriTTS-R

- <https://www.openslr.org/141/> — Koizumi et al., 2023.
- 585 hours, 2,456 speakers, natively 24 kHz; a speech-restored version of
  LibriTTS with identical content.
- **CC BY 4.0.**
- Used for multi-speaker work and for the "different narrator" floor anchor.
  Native 24 kHz matches what `tts.py` writes, so no resampling confound.

### LibriTTS

- <https://www.openslr.org/60/> — Zen et al., Interspeech 2019.
- **CC BY 4.0.** Derived from LibriSpeech's original LibriVox mp3 audio and
  Project Gutenberg texts.
- Superseded by LibriTTS-R for audio quality; recorded here because -R is
  derived from it and the alignment work is theirs.

### LibriVox

- <https://librivox.org> — **public domain.**
- The upstream source of all of the above, and the fallback if a specific
  narrator, book or language is wanted that the derived corpora do not cover.

### Project Gutenberg

- <https://www.gutenberg.org> — the text side of every corpus above.

None of this audio is redistributed by us. The corpora are downloaded to
`ab_test_runtime/corpora/`, which is gitignored; `PROVENANCE.md` there records
what to fetch and from where.

### Non-English speech corpora (candidates, not yet used)

Recorded 2026-08-05 while answering "is there anything open source, not
necessarily English". Listed with licences so the choice is auditable before
any of it is downloaded.

**[Kokoro Speech Dataset](https://mozilladatacollective.com/datasets/cmmknsho4014wmf087kvq5rc6)**
— the closest match to what this project actually generates.

- 43,253 clips, a single speaker, reading 14 novels.
- **Public domain**: Aozora Bunko texts + LibriVox recordings, both PD.
- Japanese, single-speaker, audiobook register - the same shape as LJSpeech,
  so `ljspeech_prepare.py` / `ljspeech_build.py` apply with a different root.
- **We already hold the text side.** `ab_test_runtime/corpora/aozora/kokoro.txt`
  is Natsume Sōseki's こころ, downloaded for the Japanese quote-robustness work.
  This corpus is LibriVox audio of that same text.

**[Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03411)** — **CC0**,
public domain. English, German, Dutch, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese,
Polish, from LibriVox + Gutenberg. The multi-language equivalent of the
English work.

**[CSS10](https://github.com/Kyubyong/css10)** — single speaker in ten
languages including **Japanese**, Chinese, Russian, Greek, Finnish, Hungarian,
from LibriVox. Single-speaker-per-language is exactly the voice-LoRA shape.

**[Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org)** — **CC0**, ~9,283 hours
across 60 languages. Read Wikipedia sentences rather than audiobook
performance, so useful for speaker variety and a floor anchor, less so for
narration register.

**[CML-TTS](https://github.com/freds0/CML-TTS-Dataset)** — **CC BY 4.0**,
MLS adapted for TTS: Dutch, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese,
Spanish.

**[JSUT / JVS](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ast/41/5/41_E1950/_pdf)** —
Japanese, 10 h single speaker and 30 h across 100 speakers. Check the current
licence terms before use; they are free for research but not obviously the same
blanket public domain as the LibriVox-derived sets.

**J-MAC** — Japanese multi-speaker audiobook corpus, ~150 audiobooks. Built
from commercial Audiobook.jp recordings with Aozora reference text, so the
AUDIO is not redistributable the way the above are. Noted for completeness and
deliberately not a candidate.

## Corpora and annotations used for attribution training and evaluation (added 2026-09-19)

Recorded here because the notices file is where a rights question gets
written down, and `ab_test_runtime/corpora/PROVENANCE.md` has pointed at this
file for the Chinese sets since August without the entry existing.

| corpus | licence | how it is used | shipped? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Project Dialogism Novel Corpus (PDNC)](https://github.com/Priya22/project-dialogism-novel-corpus) — Vishnubhotla, Hammond, Hirst | **none stated.** The 28 novels are public domain; the repository declares no licence for the annotations (checked 2026-09-19: no LICENSE file, no wording in the ReadMe). | Quotation-to-speaker labels: 20 novels train the rights-clean adapters, 8 are evaluation fixtures (`pdnc_fixture.py`). | **Adapters trained on it are public on the Hub** (`Om22s/alexandria-qwen3-attribution`). Permission to train and redistribute has been requested from the authors; every card states the licence is unstated until they answer. The corpus itself is not redistributed. |
| [RiQuA](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/research/resources/corpora/riqua/) — Papay & Padó, LREC 2020 | no licence file; the paper says "publicly available for use, modification, and experimentation" (availability wording, not a named licence). Texts public domain. | Training rows (`riqua_trainset.py`); Emma excluded because it is a fixture. | adapters public; corpus not redistributed |
| [DraCor](https://dracor.org) play corpora | per-play TEI `<licence>`; the builder (`dracor_trainset.py`) keeps CC0 / public-domain / CC BY(-SA) plays and refuses BY-NC / ND. `ibs` is BY-NC despite the registry and is excluded. | Prose renderings of speaker-labelled plays as training rows. | adapters public; corpus not redistributed |
| Chinese quotation attribution sets — WP (World of Plainness, 平凡的世界) and JY (Jin Yong) | **Apache-2.0** (the released speaker-identification datasets; characters anonymised as `[C0]`…) | Evaluation only (`chinese_attribution.py`). | no |
| JY-QuotePlus | **no licence**, and it annotates a novel still in copyright. | Evaluation of the Chinese frame only (`chinese_attribution_frame.py`), which records the same caveat in its artifact. | no; nothing trained on it |
| [LibriQuote](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gasmichel/LibriQuote) — Michel, Epure, Cerisara, Findings of ACL 2026 | **CC BY-NC 4.0** | Evidence only: quotes-trained vs narration-trained voice adapters, cross-scored. | **never** — nothing trained on it ships |
| [LitBank](https://github.com/dbamman/litbank) / BookNLP — Bamman et al. | CC BY 4.0 (LitBank) | The published attribution baseline our end-to-end PDNC number is compared against (`external_comparability.py`); no data copied. | no |

## Speech corpora used since 2026-08-05

The 2026-08-05 section above listed Kokoro as a candidate. It and three more
are now in use; all four are fetched to the gitignored `ab_test_runtime/corpora/`
by the scripts named, none is redistributed.

| corpus | licence | used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Kokoro Speech Dataset](https://mozilladatacollective.com/datasets/cmmknsho4014wmf087kvq5rc6) | public domain (Aozora texts, LibriVox recordings) | the Japanese human ceiling for goals 2.1, 2.5, 2.6, 2.9 (`kokoro_fetch.py`) |
| [AISHELL-3](https://www.openslr.org/93/) | Apache-2.0 | the Chinese human ceiling (`aishell3_prepare.py`) |
| [Hi-Fi TTS](https://www.openslr.org/109/) | CC BY 4.0 (LibriVox audio, Gutenberg text) | a second English reader for goal 2.1 (`hifitts_fetch.py`) |
| LJSpeech | public domain | as above |

## Models used for measurement (not shipped)

| model | licence | used in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `torchaudio.pipelines.MMS_FA` (Meta MMS forced aligner) | **CC-BY-NC 4.0** | `aligned_japanese_accent.py` — mora alignment for goal 2.9. Evaluation only; no shipped feature calls it. |
| `jonatasgrosman/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-chinese-zh-cn` | Apache-2.0 | `contextual_tone_model.py` — Mandarin syllable alignment for 2.9 |
| `speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb` | Apache-2.0 | every ECAPA speaker-similarity number (`_ecapa_batch.py`, `voice_reference.py`) — this one is also used by the shipped drift check |
| [pyopenjtalk](https://github.com/r9y9/pyopenjtalk) / OpenJTalk | MIT / modified BSD | Japanese accent labels (`expected_prosody.py`, `aligned_japanese_accent.py`) |
| [Muse-Glimmer-30B](https://huggingface.co/meta-models/Muse-Glimmer-30B), Qwen3 / Qwen3.6 / Qwen3.8 | Apache-2.0 | attribution bases; adapters for the Qwen models are published, trained as recorded in RECIPES |
| DeepSeek v4-pro (API) | vendor terms | the cloud ceiling in RECIPES; nothing trained on its outputs except the distillation rows RECIPES names, none of which is in a public adapter |

## Research consulted since 2026-08-05

- Michel, Epure, Cerisara — the Michel et al. prompt formulation and LibriQuote (above).
- The nine papers read 2026-09-13 (usual-suspect prior, hard-case selection, prosodic pruning, quotes-vs-narration, chapter cuts) — findings and which held are in `docs/` and RECIPES; no code or text taken.
- Vishnubhotla, Hammond, Hirst — PDNC and the alias-oracle caveat on every published PDNC number (GOALS 1.3).
